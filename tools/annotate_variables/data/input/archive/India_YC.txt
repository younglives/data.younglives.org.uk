Household Level Data(from Household Questionnaire)
This section describes the variables and their codes found in the file IN_YC_ChildLevel.sav, which come directly from the Young Lives questionnaire. There is only one record per child/household. The following codes are standard across most of the numeric variables in the dataset:
77=Not known (NK)– This is where the respondent says they do not know;
88=Not applicable(N/A)– This is where the question is not applicable because of a response given to an earlier question;
99=Missing – The question was missed during fieldwork or was not clearly recorded;
79=Refused to answer – The respondent did not want to answer the question.
For variables where these values are feasible for the question the missing value codes are negative. Also for year-codes, the missing value codes are composed of 4 digits instead of 2; i.e. 7777= NK, 8888=N/A, 9999= Missing. For year-code variables, the code 79= Refused to answer has not been generated.
