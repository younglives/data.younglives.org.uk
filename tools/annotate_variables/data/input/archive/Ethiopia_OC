Ethiopia Data Dictionary- Older Cohort Dataset	 

Data Files
A total of 13 data files are generated from the Ethiopia Older Cohort dataset.  The two main data files are ET_OC_HouseholdLevel.sav and ET_OC_ChildLevel.sav. The file title: ET_OC_HouseholdLevel.sav holds data at the household level (one record per household) and the file titled: ET_OC_ChildLevel.sav holds data at the child level (one record per child). Because of the large number of variables at this level we have kept the variables from the Child Questionnaire separate from those from the household questionnaire.  The remaining data files hold data at a lower level.  For example ET_OC_HouseholdMemberLevel.sav has one record for each member of the household – i.e. potentially several records per household.  The following table lists the 13 data files which are detailed in the rest of this document.

Household Level Data (From Household Questionnaire)
This section describes the variables and their codes found in the file ET_OC_HouseholdLevel.sav  which come directly from the Young Lives Household questionnaire.  The following codes are standard across most of the numeric variables in the dataset:
77=Not known – this is where the respondent says they do not know;
88=Not applicable – this is where the question is not applicable because of a response given to an earlier question;
99=Missing – the question was missed during fieldwork or was not clearly recorded;
79=Refused to answer – the respondent did not want to answer the question.
For variables where these values are feasible for the question the missing value codes are negative. Also for year-codes, the missing value codes are composed of 4 digits instead of 2; i.e. 7777= NK, 8888=N/A, 9999= Missing. For year-code variables, the code 79= Refused to answer has not been generated.
