   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This paper presents a case study to illustrate the range of decisions involved in designing a sampling strategy for a complex, longitudinal research study. It is based on experience from the Young Lives project and identifies the approaches used to sample children for longitudinal follow-up in four countries. The rationale for decisions made and the resulting benefits, and
limitations, of the approaches adopted are discussed. Of particular importance is choice of sampling approach to yield useful analysis and particular examples are presented of how this
informed the design of the Young Lives sampling strategy. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This paper is one of two preliminary first findings reports that make use of early data from
the third round of the Young Lives survey of children growing up in four countries – Ethiopia,
India (Andhra Pradesh), Peru and Vietnam – over 15 years. This briefing explores the extent to
which inequalities including poverty, location (rural or urban), ethnicity or caste, and gender,
are changing over time and how this may affect life chances for children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The paper concludes by considering the policy implications of these first findings, including
the need to protect existing social budget expenditure and ensuring services are adapted
to the needs of the poorest and most marginalised children. Policies aimed at intervening
in poverty cycles need to take into account how inequalities intersect to inform the
expansion of services and social protection schemes and improvements in the accessibility,
appropriateness and quality of education and healthcare are essential in order to provide a
strong foundation for child development and learning and for children to access better-paid
employment in the future. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This paper explores diverse pathways through early childhood in the context of Andhra
Pradesh state, India. The particular focus is on experiences of pre-school and transitions to
primary school. The paper is based on analysis of Young Lives survey data (n=1950)
collected for a group of young children born at the beginning of the millennium, plus in-depth
qualitative research with a small sub-sample (n=24). We start from the premise that
children’s earliest educational experiences can have a crucial influence on their lifelong
adjustments and achievements. Superficially, the evidence from Young Lives research is
quite positive, suggesting equitable access to early childhood provision as well as high levels
of primary school attendance. However, overall percentages are misleading and disguise
major differences in early transition experiences. Many of these differences are shaped by
the co-existence of a long established network of government anganwadis under the
Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) programme, alongside a rapidly growing
(relatively unregulated) private sector at both pre-school and primary levels. Parental
decision making around private versus government education has been fuelled by the
possibility of improved life opportunities in a rapidly changing economy and the attractiveness
of English medium teaching, even at the earliest stages (more commonly available in the
private sector). The paper identifies four quite distinct trajectories related to availability and
choice of pre-school and primary school. Parental aspirations for individual boys and girls
combined with beliefs about relative quality of government and private schools seem to
shape individual trajectories in ways that seem likely to reproduce or even reinforce inequities
related to wealth, location, caste and gender. The consequence for children is in many cases
having to cope with multiple transitions during their early years, which may entail changing
schools in an effort to ‘up-grade’ in perceived quality (e.g. from a government to private
school), or moving into distant hostels or with relatives in order to attend better schools or to
access grades unavailable locally. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Young Lives is a longitudinal research project investigating the changing nature of
childhood poverty. The study is tracking the development of 12,000 children in Ethiopia,
Peru, India (Andhra Pradesh) and Vietnam through qualitative and quantitative research
over a 15-year period. Since 2002 it has been following two cohorts in each study country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this report are to describe the first round sample and the sampling
design of Young Lives in Peru, and to derive appropriate sampling weights needed to
use the data. In addition, by comparing Young Lives with nationally representative surveys
that were carried out at the same time that the Young Lives sample was collected, we
provide an assessment of potential biases in the Young Lives data. Finally, the comparison
between the national census data and Young Lives allows us to suggest potential poststratification
weights that may be used to adjust Young Lives sample estimates to a
known population at national or regional level.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The report examines how appropriate it is to use Young Lives sample averages without
considering the sampling design. The finding of this analysis might also be applicable
to the three other Young Lives countries. The comparison of Young Lives data to other
datasets allows us to: (i) make Young Lives comparable with national surveys carried
out in the country at specific periods; (ii) identify and characterise potential biases in the
Young Lives sample; and (iii) evaluate scope for adjusting Young Lives sample estimates
to known population figures through post-stratification.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This report is structured as follows. In section 2, we review the sampling strategy used in
the four countries to select the Young Lives samples. Then we specify the strategy used in
Peru. In section 3, we compare simple, weight-adjusted averages of Young Lives data with
data from the Peruvian LSMS (ENAHO 2001) from the Instituto Nacional de Estadística
e Informática (INEI, National Institute for Statistics and Informatics) (INEI 2001a) and the
Peruvian Demographic and Health Survey 2000 (DHS 2000) (INEI 2001b). The comparison
allows us to assess biases in the Young Lives sample. In section 4, we compare data from
Young Lives and the DHS 2000 with data from the Peruvian Household and Population
Census 2005 (INEI 2006). We use a post-stratification strategy in the comparisons that
may be used to adjust Young Lives sampling averages. Finally, section 5 summarises the
results and defines the methodological steps needed to do similar adjustments in the other
Young Lives countries. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ The Young Lives Project is a longitudinal study in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam. In each of the countries, the first phase of the project included the first survey of 2,000 index children aged around one year and a survey of 1,000 children aged around eight years, evenly spread across 20 sentinel sites per country. The Young Lives Project is unique in measuring child well-being in a holistic and consistent way across several developing countries, including economic, social, physical and demographic aspects. Data collection finished in 2003 and an important priority has been the early production of a preliminary report from each country, each report following a similar structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Vietnam the project is implemented by three organisations, the Research and Training Centre for
Community Development (RTCCD), General Statistics Office (GSO) and Save the Children UK. In terms of the first round of research, 2000 index children aged 6-17.9 months and 1000 children aged 7.5-8.5 years and their households were selected from 20 sentinel sites across five provinces. Survey methods included household questionnaires, anthropometry, a  questionnaire and a test of mental aptitude for eight-year-old children, and a community questionnaire. Fieldwork was
undertaken in late 2002.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this preliminary report are to: present a brief literature review of child poverty in Vietnam; review national policies which have an impact on child poverty; identify key national audiences for this study; describe the study methods, present preliminary, descriptive results, and identify provisional conclusions and policy implications.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;In each study country, Young Lives is following 2000 children who were born in 2001-2 and 1000 children who were born in 1994-5. The younger children are being tracked from infancy to their mid-teens and the older children to adulthood, when some will become parents themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report presents initial findings from the second round of quantitative data collection which was carried out in Andhra Pradesh in late 2006 to early 2007. It gives a broad outline of the some of the key indicators of childhood poverty and changes that have taken place in the children's lives between the first round of data collection in 2002 and this second round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summary comments on the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levels of wealth, consumption and poverty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Household factors that contribute to poverty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The importance of parental education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drought and other shocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nutrition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Child labour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subjective well-being&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;Young Lives is an ambitious and innovative research programme, which brings together many elements and ways of working - a panel of quantitative data (with the second round of data collection having been completed in the reporting year); a new qualitative research stream which will bring depth and richness to our analysis; a complex data management system; explicit policy influencing aims; and the ambition and commitment to communicate this multifaceted research and exciting methodology as broadly as possible, to influence policy, thinking and practice in the four study countries and internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The twelve months from October 2006 to September 2007 have been a period of consolidation, starting with the final transfer of the budget and full management responsibility for Young Lives to the University of Oxford (Department of International Development-Queen Elizabeth House) in late 2006, the recruitment of new research and management staff in early 2007, and concerted fundraising efforts leading up to the ESRC review of the project in September/October 2007. This has also been a period where great advances have been made in the research: the second round of the quantitative survey was carried out between September 2006 and March 2007 (dates varying according to country) and the data is currently being cleaned and archived, with new data management techniques being developed; and the qualitative research stream has been conceptualised, the research questions and methods formulated, pilots undertaken in all 4 study countries, with the first full round of data gathering currently underway (from August to November 2007). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new qualitative research stream is vital to our revised study design and conceptualisation, which will contribute not only to a holistic, multi-dimensional analysis of poverty, but also focus on psycho-social dimensions of childhood poverty, incorporating children's and their caregivers' perspectives into our work. Furthermore, our efforts to incorporate data about the political/policy context, the community, household and child, makes a truly ecological analysis possible, helping us to understand the personal, political, social, cultural, economic and environmental factors that influence child outcomes. This has been complemented by a refocusing of our policy and communications work, with the drafting of policy engagement strategies for each country, new policy analysis methodologies, and the development of a communications strategy to take Young Lives to the end of the current phase of research (June 2009) and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the complexity of the programme, this report should be read in conjunction with the presentation document produced in May 2007. This is not a definitive statement on the programme, but does summarise our research methodology (triangulation of quantitative, qualitative, and policy research to provide a rich and in-depth body of knowledge about children's lives, their homes and their communities over 15 years), the principles that underpin our work and our approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the aims of Young Lives are to:&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improve understanding of the causes and consequences of childhood poverty and to examine how policies affect children's well-being&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inform the development and implementation of future policies and practices that will reduce childhood poverty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The preliminary national report on Ethopia has the following objectives: to briefly present what is known about child poverty in Ethiopia; to review policies expected to have an impact on child poverty; to identify key stakeholders for this study; to describe the methods used in the study; to present preliminary results from surveys of 2,000 households with one-year-old children, and 1,000 households with eight-year-old children; and to present some provisional conclusions and policy implications. Twenty sentinel sites were selected from five regions of the country for the survey. A summary of the main results of the surveys is presented. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description> Participatory research into how people living in material poverty define and experience well-being and ill-being is increasingly common in developed and developing countries. Such research highlights the importance of experiential aspects, such as being respected and able to preserve one's dignity, and having meaningful choices. Nevertheless, these findings rarely cover children's experiences and are often not contextualized or triangulated with other data. The paper will extend this exploration using data from qualitative research with a sub-sample of children aged 11-13 in three urban and rural communities, drawn from Young Lives, a long-term international research project investigating the changing nature of childhood poverty in four countries, including Ethiopia. Firstly, it addresses how understandings of a good life and what is needed to achieve one varies between communities and amongst children of different backgrounds living in those communities; for example, boys and girls and children from richer or poorer households. Secondly, the study examines how one's place in social relationships also contributes to how children perceive and understand what a good life is. The paper confirms the importance of allowing children to take at least a 'partial role' in measuring and monitoring their well-being (Ben-Arieh 2005, 575) and provides examples of how this might be done. </dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Study objective: The concept of social capital has influenced mental health policies of nations and international organisations despite its limited evidence base. This papers aims to systematically review quantitative studies examining the association between social capital and mental illness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Design and setting: Twenty electronic databases and the reference sections of papers were searched to identify published studies. Authors of papers were contacted for unpublished work. Anonymised papers were reviewed by the authors of this paper. Papers with a validated mental illness outcome and an exposure variable agreed as measuring social capital were included. No limitations were put on date or language of publication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Main results: Twenty one studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. Fourteen measured social capital at the individual level and seven at an ecological level. The former offered evidence for an inverse relation between cognitive social capital and common mental disorders. There was moderate evidence for an inverse relation between cognitive social capital and child mental illness, and combined measures of social capital and common mental disorders. The seven ecological studies were diverse in methodology, populations investigated, and mental illness outcomes, making them difficult to summarise. 
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conclusions: Individual and ecological social capital may measure different aspects of the social environment. Current evidence is inadequate to inform the development of specific social capital interventions to combat mental illness.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This paper investigates whether the death of a parent during middle childhood affects child schooling and subjective well-being (SWB) in Ethiopia. The data comes from two rounds of the Young Lives survey, conducted in 2002 and 2006, of an initial sample of 1000 children across 20 sentinel sites in Ethiopia. The children were 7 to 8 years of age in 2002 and 11 to 12 years of age in 2006, with around 80 losing a parent between rounds. The research finds that the mother dying reduces school enrolment significantly by around 20 per cent. It also increases the chance that a child cannot write at all (even with difficulty) by around 21 percent, and cannot read at all or can read only letters (rather than words or sentences) by around 27 per cent, compared to if the mother had not died. In contrast, the father dying seems to negatively affect a child's sense of optimism about the future, even though they feel they are treated with greater fairness and respect than had their father not died. A child's gender does not affect the results. A change in caregiver between rounds seems to explain only a part of the lower outcomes. These findings have significant policy implications for Ethiopia where parental death has become a very potent shock that children are likely to face in middle childhood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A separate 1-page Research Summary, which presents the main findings and policy implications of the Working Paper in easily understood language, is also attached.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ In recent years, a growing body of literature has pointed to the importance of children's experiences of preschool and first grade as foundational for success during the subsequent school years. However, most of this research has been carried out in industrialised countries and has paid little attention to developing countries. This paper therefore seeks to contribute to this area by paying attention to the Latin-American context, where repetition and drop-out rates tend to be high, and taking as a case study an Andean country characterised by cultural diversity. Young Lives in Peru has conducted qualitative research on a subsample of four communities throughout the country, which represent different socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. This paper describes findings in relation to data generated on the preparedness of schools and teachers for facilitating transition to first grade; parents' perspectives on early schooling; how much information they have on the transition; and the ways in which children experience this transition. In this way, the research shows how childhood is represented and experienced during early childhood transitions and across different domains (home, school, community). A mixed method approach was used, combining interviews with parents, teachers and children; participatory techniques with children; home and community observations; and classroom observation at preschool and primary levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A separate 1-page Research Summary, which presents the main findings and policy implications of the Working Paper in easily understood language, is also attached. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Objective: The mental health of children living in low-income countries remains a neglected research area despite the high burden of disease. This study is one of the first that examines the effects of long-term physical health problems on child mental health disorders in a low-income country and investigates whether this association is modified by the socio-economic status of the child’s family. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Methods: Community-based cross-sectional survey of 975 eight-year-old children from 20 sites in Vietnam. Long-term physical health problems were measured by a caregiver report and included conditions such as anaemia, congenital malformation, physical disability and skin problems. Child mental disorders were assessed using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ). Generalised estimating equations models were fitted to explore the association between long-term physical health problems and child mental disorders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Results: Vietnamese children who suffer from long-term physical health problems have odds 2:1 times greater than children without long-term physical health problems of having a mental disorder (95% CI 1.2 to 3.6, p&amp;#8202;=&amp;#8202;0.006). No significant interaction with socio-economic status was found. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Conclusions: This study showed a high burden of mental disorders among physically ill children, re-enforcing the idea that there is “no health without mental health”. While this association needs to be explored longitudinally, children with long-term health problems may be a visible group for targeted mental-health interventions.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Objective:  To adapt a scale to measure perceptions on food insecurity and hunger among households in urban and rural communities in Peru.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Design:  Qualitative and quantitative methodology including consultation with regional experts, key informant interviews and focus groups. A field survey trial was conducted in urban and rural communities using an adapted version of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Insecurity and Hunger Module (FIHM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Setting:  Five communities in three regions in Peru – Lima (coast), Ayacucho (Andean highlands) and San Martín (Amazon basin).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Subjects:  The qualitative component included forty intentionally selected people (fourteen key informants and twenty-six focus group participants). For the quantitative component 300 households that complied with selection criteria (poor or non-poor with at least one child below 12 years of age) were surveyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Results:  Qualitative research showed that concern about food availability and access was common among the three regions but its main cause varied across them. Participation in food aid programmes was a strategy to face constraints in food access. Mothers’ perceptions on the importance of balanced meals varied across households from different regions. Quantitative results showed robust findings for the reliability of the adapted FIHM’s fifteen-item scale (r &gt; 0·863). In addition, descriptive results confirmed parallelism of item responses in the scale for variables such as farm ownership, family size and use of Communal Kitchens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Conclusions:  This mixed-method study allowed us to adapt the USDA module to assess food insecurity in Peru.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Establishing panel studies in developing countries is difficult, owing to the absence of routine long-term surveillance systems found in developed countries. Consequently, these studies need
particularly careful design to ensure that all necessary information is captured at the outset and that the data are maintained in a format suitable for longitudinal analysis. Under these circumstances, the pilot study becomes particularly important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A pilot study for the Young Lives International Study of Childhood Poverty was carried out in
South Africa during 2001 and 2002. The pilot included developing the various survey instruments, the approaches to fieldwork, a data entry system and an analysis package. Households containing 166 one-year-old children and 107 eight-year-olds were included.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the pilot study are discussed in terms of the processes followed and the lessons
learnt for running large panel studies in developing countries. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description> An important component of the Ethiopian government's poverty reduction strategy is investment in human capital. Using government audited accounts and Ministry of Education data, this paper presents the findings of a benefit incident analysis of the Ethiopian education sector, in order to assess how pro-poor public expenditure on education has been since 1995/96. Unlike prior benefit incident studies on Ethiopia, our results present a dynamic picture of changes in benefit accrued to different sub-populations over time (rural/urban location, regional states, girls and boys) at both the primary and secondary level. The paper finds that the Education Sector Development Policy has been pro-poor, pro-rural and has significantly narrowed the gender gap at the primary school level. However, in order to make further inroads into tackling wealth, gender, and regional disparities in educational access, the conclusion highlights a number of key policy challenges. </dc:description>

   <dc:title>Technical Note No. 4. An Assessment of the Young Lives Sampling Approach in Vietnam.</dc:title>
   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Young Lives is a longitudinal research project investigating the changing nature of childhood
poverty. The study is tracking the development of 12,000 children in Ethiopia, Peru, India
(Andhra Pradesh) and Vietnam through qualitative and quantitative research over a 15-year
period. Since 2002, the study is following two cohorts in each study country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To fit the main objectives of the project, Young Lives employed a sentinel site sampling
method, which is a multistage sampling approach and uses both purposive and probability
sampling methods. The aim of this report is to assess the chosen sampling methodology. Therefore, the report
investigates the representativeness of Young Lives data by comparing selected variables
from the Young Lives sample with those from two nationally representative surveys: the
Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey 2002 (VLSS 2002) and the Demographic and
Health Survey 2002 (DHS 2002). The aim of the comparison is to establish to what extent the
Young Lives sample in Vietnam is a poorer or richer sub-population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The structure of this report is as follows. Section 2 describes the sampling design adopted by
Young Lives Vietnam. Section 3 discusses the representativeness of Young Lives' first round
data in Vietnam. Section 4 and 5 compare the Young Lives sample with the DHS sample
using different methodologies including comparison of distribution of wealth index by
household. Section 6 concludes. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description> This paper studies the effect of economic shocks on household human capital investment patterns using a sample of 6 to 14-year-old children going through the Peruvian education system. While other studies have analysed the impact of shocks on the accumulation of human capital, based chiefly on an analysis of school attendance, this study employs a more comprehensive analysis of the various mechanisms through which spending on education can be affected by short-term economic shocks. Evidence was found that is consistent with the hypothesis that shocks have an impact on the quality rather than the quantity of education. Even when a negative shock did not reduce the time spent on education, it reduced the effective accumulation of human capital through cuts in spending on education, in both rural and urban areas. Results are significant both when a short-term shock is brought about by changes in household income or expenses and when it is brought about by changes in employment status. </dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Getting estimates of the cognitive abilities and achievements over time of children that are
participating in the YL project is important as these variables may be considered both
outcomes (proxy for the individual's skills) and predictors of later outcomes. The main concern in administering and using the results of these tests is that their reliability
and validity is established before using the data for research. This is because these tests for
the most part were not developed for the specific contexts in which they were used in YL. Hence, the main goal of the analysis presented in this paper is to establish the reliability and
validity of each of the tests administered for each cohort within each country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The paper is organised into six sections, including an introduction. The second section
presents the framework for the analysis, introducing definitions and theories of validity and
reliability. Section three includes a description of each of the cognitive development and
achievement instruments used in the YL project. The fourth section presents information on
the data and methods used in this paper, and the results on the psychometric characteristics
of the tests are presented in section five. Finally, in section six, some considerations about
the use of the test scores are presented, as well as recommendations for the assessment of
cognitive development and achievement in Round 3 of the YL project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data and statistics are provided in separate annexes to the main Technical Note. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:title>Comparative quality of private and public health services in rural Vietnam</dc:title>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Background: Private health care services were officially recognized in Vietnam in 1989, and for the last 15 years have competed with the public health system in providing primary curative care and pharmaceutical sales to rural populations. However, the quality of these private and public health care services has not been evaluated and compared. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Methods: A community-based survey was conducted in 30 of the 160 communes in Hung Yen, which were selected by probability proportional to population size (PPS) sampling. All commune health centres (CHCs) and private health care providers in the selected communes were surveyed on human resources, services provided, availability of medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, knowledge and clinical performance for acute and chronic problems. Patient satisfaction and cost of care associated with recent illness were measured using a random household survey covering 30 households from each of the selected communes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Results: There were 11.5 private providers per 10 000 population, compared with 6.7 public providers per 10 000. A quarter of private providers were employees of the public health sector. Less than 20% of the private providers had registered their practice with the government system. Eleven per cent (26/234) had no professional qualifications. Fifty-eight per cent (135/234) provided treatment as well as selling medications. Public sector infrastructure was superior to that of the private providers. The quality of services provided by public providers was poor but significantly better than that of private providers. Patient satisfaction and costs of care were similar between the two groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Conclusions: Private providers are successfully competing with the public health centre system in rural areas but not because they provide cheaper or better services. The quality of private health care services is not controlled and is significantly poorer than public services. Current practice in both systems falls below the national standard, especially for the management of chronic health problems. The low quality of health care services at a community level may help explain the previously observed phenomena of high levels of self-medicating, low utilization of commune health centres and over-utilization of tertiary health care facilities.

A Literature Review.]]></dc:title>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This document provides a broad context for the Young Lives research being done in Peru by
reviewing the academic literature, research findings, statistics and official documents
available. It was carried out by the Young Lives qualitative researchers, and thus privileges
the main areas to be explored by qualitative research in its first two rounds of data collection
(2007 and 2008). The document identifies gaps which the Young Lives research could fill and
areas of further investigation which the project could focus on. By examining the available
literature, it shows which areas have been covered thoroughly and which have not been the
specific focus of much research. It also briefly examines the extent to which this research has
influenced government policy, and whether this policy is effectively implemented.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main themes the review focuses on are children’s key transitions, their access to
services and their well-being. Transitions are defined as ‘key events and/or processes
occurring at specific periods or turning points during the life course’ (Vogler et al. 2008).
These include educational transitions, such as going from home or a pre-school setting to
primary school, and from primary to secondary school, experiences that Young Lives children
were undergoing at the time of survey and case study data collection (2006/7–2007/8
respectively). As the review makes clear, ‘transitions’ as such is not a topic which has been
studied much, and the information gathered on these transitions comes from a variety of
sources. The topic of ‘socialisation’, for example as well as related concepts such as life
cycle or life course, yielded interesting information about a variety of transitions, including
baptisms, indigenous traditions and integration into the wider community, as well as the
home–school transitions mentioned above. The availability, access and quality of services for
children and their families are examined in a variety of studies considered here, especially
those evaluating the functioning and results of such services. Finally, child well-being is
addressed, looking at general welfare indicators and some specific topics such as violence,
work, resilience and development. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This paper investigates the impact of usage patterns of water and sanitation on the
health of children in Ethiopia, once supply side factors are controlled for. A
comprehensive set of controls is employed to account for individual heterogeneity
driven by time-invariant unobservables, time-invariant and time-variant observables.
The results from the pooled cross-section estimated by OLS suggest that there is a
strong relationship between water and sanitation choices of a household and a child's
weight-for-age z-scores. This correlation disappears when unobserved time-invariant
fixed effects are removed through a fixed effects specification. However, the fixed
effects model reveals that children from the poorest families who improved usage
patterns of water and sanitation exhibited a significantly larger growth in weight-for-age
z-scores between the two periods. The effect remains robust across a number of
different specifications, including a dynamic model to allow for catch-up effects and an
instrumented version of a dynamic model. Consequently, the effectiveness of
investments in water and sanitation infrastructure can be leveraged by influencing the
choices made by households regarding the type of water and sanitation. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This paper explores the relationship between migration and educational aspirations among young people growing up in contexts of poverty in Peru. It draws on a mixed survey and qualitative data set collected by Young Lives (YL), an international fifteen-year study of childhood poverty. The focus is on data generated with the older of two cohorts of YL children being studied in Peru. They were around eight years old when the study began in 2002 and were twelve years old at the last point of data collection in 2007. This paper provides evidence to suggest that young people and their caregivers connect migration with the process of 'becoming somebody in life' (ser algo o alguien en la vida). This entails making successful transitions to adulthood and out of poverty. Their educational aspirations and expectations are
at the core of their view of their future; these are generated against a country backdrop of economic and social inequalities, a recent history of political violence and resulting mass displacement, and established and diverse patterns of internal and international migration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A separate 1-page Research Summary, which presents the main findings and policy implications of the Working Paper in easily understood language, is also attached.

   <dc:description> This article explores efforts to bridge multi-disciplinary research and policy engagement to tackle child poverty in the contexts of developing countries, based on the experiences of Young Lives, an international longitudinal policy-research project. It focuses on a case study involving the application of research evidence on child poverty to shape policy debates concerning Ethiopia's second-generation Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (2006-2010). The discussion is situated within theoretical literature on the interface between knowledge, policy, and practice, which supports the conceptualisation of policy making as a non-linear dynamic process. It pays particular attention to the importance of understanding the political and policy contexts of Southern countries, rather than assuming that they should simply import Northern-derived models of advocacy. It concludes by identifying general lessons for translating research into social-policy change. </dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Vietnam recognises the need to improve both access to education and quality. It has adopted
the Dakar Education for All (EFA) Framework for Action - an initiative with greater focus on
quality than those set out in the Millennium Development Goals. Vietnam's National EFA Action
Plan sets out a pathway to advance key components of the education system by 2015: early childhood care and pre-school, primary, lower-secondary and non-formal education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Young Lives project - a long-term study tracking the well-being of 3,000 children in Vietnam and three other countries, over a period of 15 years - has identified the following challenges in improving education
quality and ensuring equity:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;low basic skills acquisition
&lt;li&gt;a narrow focus on scholastic achievement by teachers who have been trained using traditional
teaching methods which fail to encourage interactive learning
&lt;li&gt;over-reliance on private tuition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;under-investment in education 'software' - curricula, teacher training, classroom resources and educational materials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;limited early child development (ECD) coverage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unequal access to education for poor, disabled and ethnic minority children&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;children failing to perform well due to inadequate nutrition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This paper reports the expectations, concerns and experiences of Peruvian children from four contrasting districts during their transition from primary to secondary school. The children who participated in this study were aged 11 to 13 years old and were part of Young Lives, a longitudinal study of childhood poverty in four countries. They were visited in two consecutive years to capture different views before, during and after the transition process. Qualitative methods were used to elicit the views of children themselves, as well as those of their parents and teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study found that children do identify a series of changes related to the different organisation and pedagogical approach in secondary schools: these are seen by children both as a difficult challenge in academic and social terms, but also as an opportunity to enjoy more freedom and autonomy and to grow up and progress in their educational careers. The study also highlights the importance of peer relationships as sources of academic and emotional support in making this transition. We argue that, to fully understand this transition, it is necessary to situate it within a particular discourse about the role of education in children’s narratives, in order to contextualise this moment and its importance in relation to children’s personal and family aims. The social and cultural meanings associated with education are related to a particular view of progress, upward mobility and modernisation, which involves becoming a professional and living in the city, and thus a major change in identity, especially for rural children. In this way, the research shows how the meanings associated with education sustain children’s transition through the school system and their expectations for the future.

household obtains its income. Furthermore, the type of diversification strategy is associated with household per capita income and a child wellbeing indicator - height-for-age z-score. We also found evidence that the presence of a young child appears to impact on diversification patterns and strategies,
with less diversification in those households with a young child. Having a young child reduced the likelihood of the mother working, although this was only statistically significant in urban households.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further examination of the data shows that, in urban areas, access to childcare facilities outside the
home is associated with improved income-generating opportunities for mothers in households with young children, enhancing their potential income diversification strategies. In rural areas, we find that improving access to daycare facilities to increase mothers' income-generating opportunities needs
to be complemented with other interventions aimed at increasing the asset base, especially maternal education. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This paper presents findings based on research carried out between 2007 and 2008 with a group of boys
and girls in Andhra Pradesh who participate in Young Lives. The research elicited children’s views on changes that
affected their households and communities over a one-year period, including in relation to broader economic crises.
While a positive economic ‘turnaround’ has been noted for Andhra Pradesh in recent years, there is still a
considerable degree of poverty and some notable regional disparities. Children identified both negative and positive
changes in their households and communities, including the significant increase in food prices, which they viewed as
a risk to child well-being. They described how the financial crisis impacted on their time-use, for example, the way
they balanced school and work, as well as how they experienced the various programmes aimed at protecting them
(Midday Meal Scheme, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), child sponsorship, etc). They
provided critical commentary on how economic and political changes impacted on children and how they coped with
them (for example by eating less or working more). Children’s views on risk and vulnerability reflected the differing
circumstances of their families’ livelihoods and of their local environments. They were knowledgeable about and at
times critical of the various services and programmes operating in their communities. Overall, their participation in
the research was active and engaged and their insights into community change were indicative of their awareness of
and involvement in their household economies and wider societies. Their experiences demonstrated that children are
not only ‘impacted’ by crisis, but that they are also active in managing the risks associated with poverty. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Most countries of the world are reducing infant and child mortality too slowly to meet the Millennium Development Goal of a two-thirds reduction by 2015. Yet, some countries and
regions have achieved impressive reductions, Kerala in India being one example. This paper examines the determinants of infant and child mortality in Andhra Pradesh, where the Young
Lives project is taking place, and Kerala and the factors explaining their differential performance. The determinants of mortality are estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Infant mortality is found to depend on biological factors, including mother's age and birth order, and also factors related to health service provision such as tetanus injection and use of antenatal
services. Economic well being is not significant once these other factors are taken into account. By contrast, economic well-being is a significant determinant of child mortality, but substantially
outweighed in importance by other factors such as maternal education and knowledge of health practices (ORS) and access to safe water. The data also show gender discrimination in Andhra Pradesh, notably toward girls with only female siblings, which is absent from Kerala. We conclude that raising service levels across India toward the levels found in Kerala is a  necessary step toward meeting the MDGs, and that the success of these efforts is reinforced by female empowerment. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Ethiopia has one of the lowest primary school enrolment rates and one of the highest illiteracy rates in the world. Government efforts have focused on expanding access to primary education, particularly in rural areas, but as a consequence, insufficient resources have been allocated to improving the quality of education. Another key problem in Ethiopia is the presence of
regional, urban/rural and gender disparities in enrolment. There is an additional dimension that needs to be tackled in order to improve schooling indicators. While the general focus has been on supply of educational services, not much attention has been paid to out-of-school factors that influence the demand for schooling. This is a concern which the Young Lives Project (YL) - a 15-year longitudinal policy-research project in four countries (Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh), Peru and Vietnam) which
aims to reveal the links between international and national policies and children's day-to-day lives, with the objective
of influencing national policies to improve the wellbeing of children living in poverty - seeks to emphasise. This Policy Brief, based on Young Lives Working Paper 15, examines factors affecting demand for school in Ethiopia, and the policy implications. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description> The first phase (2000-2003) of Young Lives was supported by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) with the purpose 'to measure and find out about what happens to children born into poverty in the millennium'. This paper sets out the conceptual framework that underpins the project and was developed prior to the design of the data collection instruments in Phase 1. Section 2 gives a brief overview of approaches to conceptualising childhood and the concept of childhood adopted by Young Lives. Section 3 considers what is meant by childhood poverty, and the reasons why it should be a focus of study in its own right. Section 4 outlines the framework for analysing the causes and consequences of childhood poverty and the reasoning behind it. </dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ As background to the Young Lives study, this paper looks at demographic, socio-economic,
and poverty trends for the state of Andhra Pradesh during the 1990s. Substantive changes in
the demographic structure, composition of economic activity, and trends in poverty are noted.
Additionally, it reviews the literature on poverty measurement issues for generic populations
as well as for children. A major unresolved issue is a standard and widely accepted definition
of childhood poverty although a number of indicators are commonly presented when
discussing quality of life for children. Following this, this paper also presents trends in
immunisation coverage, nutrition, and various educational indicators for children in Andhra
Pradesh over the 1990s.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The paper is structured as
follows: Section 2 discusses recent and anticipated changes in the demography, economy
and society. Section 3 discusses the methods for analysing poverty over space and time and
presents the issues on which the current debate on poverty is centred on focusing
particularly on Andhra Pradesh (AP). Section 4 discusses measuring childhood poverty, one
attempt at conceptualising childhood poverty and trends in three variables that are important
dimensions of scarcity for a child: vaccination, nutrition, and participation in primary
education. Section 5 concludes. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ In response to pressure to reach the Millennium Development Goal of improved sanitation access, the Ethiopian government has developed an ambitious plan to achieve 100 per cent
access to pit latrines by 2012. The plans to achieve this target rely upon the assumption that
universal access to pit latrines will lead to improved health outcomes. Using the Young Lives
pro-poor longitudinal data of Ethiopian children, this research uses propensity score matching
to test this assumption. Children who experienced a change from no toilet to a household pit
latrine between rounds of data collection were compared to those who continue to use a
forest/field. The findings show that there is no significant difference between groups in terms
of health outcomes and that a pit latrine does not necessarily signal improved methods of
waste disposal. Individual and group interviews conducted by Young Lives suggest that poor
infrastructure and care for pit latrines deter children from using such facilities and promote a

preference for the use of other methods of waste disposal. Policy makers should note that
simply increasing access to pit latrines will not necessarily promote better health outcomes,
especially when 'improved' sanitation appears to be less clean than other available options.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A separate 1-page Research Summary, which presents the main findings and policy implications of the Working Paper in easily understood language, is also attached. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description> The complexities of intergenerational and gendered intra-household resource allocations are frequently overlooked in poverty reduction policies. To address this lacuna, this article focuses on links between macro-development policies and children's paid and unpaid work burden in Ethiopia. Using a mixed methods approach, quantitative household survey data results highlight the importance of household wealth and assets, family composition and access to education services, while the qualitative results underscore the role of culturally ascribed gendered and age-specific conceptualizations of work, parental attitudes and children's agency. The article concludes with a discussion of the challenges national development plans need to address to tackle childhood poverty more effectively. </dc:description>

price rises, falls in output prices, drought, flooding and family illness and death. The global crisis provides the background to much of the current debate but we demonstrate
here that shocks were commonly experienced before the current crisis began. We explore
which households are most at risk of shocks and draw out policy implications for those

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ The period 1800 to 1950 in Britain can be seen as a period in which there was a gradual growth in social policy that reached its culmination in the post-war welfare state settlement. In
addition, it was a period that saw the development of a much more distinct, rigidly defined and more universal notion of the child and the nature of childhood. The distinct status of the child
was itself partly created through the operation of social policy. Furthermore, it was only in the latter part of this period that there was a clear working definition of what constituted poverty. It
was only after this point that the measurement and analysis of a specific phenomenon of child poverty became possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This paper charts the developments in research on child poverty and policy responses
between 1800 and 1950, and considers their relationship and interaction. In doing so there recur a number of themes, which can be summarised as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The complexity of the relationship between research and policy. That is, the impacts of
research may occur neither at the time of the research, nor in ways that are predictable. The influence of research is not necessarily in the direction in which researchers intend
and is mediated by the options available to policy makers at a particular time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need for research to be both radical and to relate to its time and place. That is, the
nature of research and its influence will vary with the political complexion of the country and ideological and religious factors. It has both to make an impact but also to accord, at least in part, with existing mores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The association of child and women's welfare. That is, interventions for children often
assume the interconnectedness of both the status and the concerns of women and children. This acknowledges the extent to which mothers' welfare is often bound up with that of their children; but it can also cause child poverty policy to be obstructed, through political resistance to women's concerns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The paper considers the increasing salience and sophistication of social research. It outlines some
of the principal moments and figures in poverty research over the 150 years; and it provides an analysis of the extent to which and the ways in which policy responded to these findings. It
argues that labour restriction and compulsory education, while not transparently increasing the well-being of the child, created the conditions under which child welfare research and policy
could more fully develop. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Child labour in India has long been the focus of research, policy concern and intervention. This article presents an analysis of children’s involvement in agricultural work, particularly cottonseed production, drawing on evidence gathered for Young Lives in 2007 and 2008. In parts of Andhra Pradesh, children work in cotton fields for two or three months of the year, with marked gender and age differentiation. In the mid-1990s, there was reportedly a cultural as well as an economic basis for children’s work in cottonseed pollination, when it was believed that pre-pubescent girls were preferred, as they were considered ‘pure’. However, the reasons for preferring children are now largely financial and practical. The article focuses on accounts from two girls who highlighted the importance of this form of work in their everyday lives and its consequences for their schooling.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Although poverty rates have reduced during the last 15 years, Peru is still one of the countries
in Latin America with the highest level of income inequality. Nearly one out of two Peruvians
lives in poverty - three out of five in the case of children1 - and one out of five is extremely
poor. Income inequalities and, more generally, inequalities in human development between
urban and rural areas, between Spanish and non-Spanish speakers and across climatic zones
are remarkable; most of the extreme poor live in rural areas in the highlands and in the rural
jungle and have Quechua, Aymara and other languages, rather than Spanish, as native
tongues. They have fewer opportunities to progress through life and, as one might expect, this
matters a great deal in explaining differences in child development indicators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within this context, the objective of this review is to describe the performance of key child
development indicators in Peru between 1993 and 2005 and to link these results with findings
from the recent literature on childhood poverty. The focus is on quantitative studies. Three
dimensions of child development are reviewed: health and nutrition, schooling and child work.
These topics are essential to understanding the persistence of poverty and childhood poverty
in Peru and, as such, remain at the core of the debate on poverty alleviation. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Following the lead of Latin American countries such as Mexico and Chile, Peru signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States in December 2005. While most economic analysis points towards overall benefits for Peru, there are concerns regarding potential adverse consequences. In order to derive maximum benefits with minimum losses, it is vital to identify appropriate mechanisms to support short-term losers - especially
children from poor families - and to develop medium-term strategies to promote more equitable distribution of benefits. Potential impacts of the FTA on poor children in Peru are discussed. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:format>text/html</dc:format>
   <dc:description><![CDATA[ In this paper, our aim is twofold. First, we seek to contextualise efforts to develop innovative methods for giving voice to children's views on poverty in Vietnam within a broader theoretical framework of research ethics and participatory research methods. We hope that this goes some way in bridging the rights&amp;#8209;based advocacy approaches of NGOs on the one hand, and researchers working within a quantitative, positivist&amp;#8209;oriented framework, on the other. The discussion draws on insights from
feminist research methodologies and feminist research ethics, action and participatory research methods, as well as recent work on research with children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We then use these insights to analyse the development and impact of Children's Fora — fora where children develop creative presentations to convey their views to policy&amp;#8209;makers — and Young Journalist
Clubs — groups where children are able to develop writing and photography skills and present their work on national and regional radio and in print media. Cognisant of some of the broader debates about the form and meaning of child participation, we pay particular attention to the development of
mechanisms through which children can be empowered to articulate their own perspectives on poverty and solutions to tackle its multiple dimensions. We argue that these initiatives are not only valuable in their own right in that they promote meaningful child participation, but that they can also be seen as
an innovative model of child&amp;#8209;sensitive research reciprocity. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ The paper explores the views of caregivers and other adults on the nature and timing of transitions made by children aged 11 to 13 in five Ethiopian communities, spanning rural, peri-urban and urban locations. The three transitions selected are schooling, work and 'early' marriage for girls, which provides a gendered example of rites of passage that are engaged in alongside institutional transitions and affect their success or failure. Adult perspectives are the focus as these are assumed to be more strongly reflective of the community norms that shape children's transitions. The paper provides a summary of the legislative and programmatic background to key transitions (for example, UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the structure of the Ethiopian schooling system and secondary
data on school attendance, grade retention, etc.) before exploring each in turn. It concludes that the rejection of government policies on marriage and education represents a critique of these rather than an attachment to 'traditional practices' which have become increasingly fragile as people respond to material poverty and environmental challenges. Policymakers need to understand and in some cases challenge 'invisible norms', but also recognise the visible economic constraints and limited opportunity structures that increase the appeal of child work or early marriage. In these communities, children's transitions are rarely linear, singular, or focused solely on 'learning', but are instead multiple and often contradictory. While children from poor communities and households are said to be constrained by their lack of opportunities, in fact their likelihood of making successful transitions is reduced by having too many potentially contradictory opportunities, too soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A separate 1-page Research Summary, which presents the main findings and policy implications of the Working Paper in easily understood language, is also attached.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Background: The nutrition and epidemiologic transition is characterised by changes in diet and
activity patterns, leading to the development of a double burden of malnutrition. At the
household level this often manifests as an overweight mother and underweight child. However,
child and adolescent overweight and obesity also appear to be on the rise in transitional
countries, although it is not well studied. Parent and child overweight are associated, and
overweight children have a greater risk of becoming overweight adults. Understanding why
these two extremes of child malnutrition occur in households with an overweight mother is
necessary for policy and programmes to target both effectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Methods: This study examined Young Lives data on 256 adolescents with overweight
(BMI&gt;23kg/m2) or obese mothers (BMI&gt;27kg/m2) from India. Child weight status was
determined using BMI-for-age z-scores based on the 2007 WHO reference median. The aim
was to identify independent predictors of child over- and underweight in two categories of dual
burden households: 61(23.8%) underweight child/overweight mother (U/O) households,
21(8.2%) overweight child/overweight mother (O/O) households. The reference category was
174(68.0%) normal weight child/overweight mother (N/O) households. Bivariate analysis was
used to examine associations between child, parent and household-level indicators and
household nutrition status. Polychotomous logistic regression techniques were employed to
identify independent predictors of U/O and O/O households compared to the reference N/O
households.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results: After controlling for nutritional and sociodemographic variables, several indicators
emerged as being significant. Households were less likely to be U/O compared to N/O if: the
child was female (OR=0.35, p&lt;0.01) or post-pubertal (OR=0.26, p&lt;0.01) or BCG immunised (a
proxy for care practice) (OR=0.44, p&lt;0.05), or the maternal support network was larger
(OR=0.20, p&lt;0.05). Households were also less likely to be O/O compared to N/O if the child
was female (OR=0.23, p&lt;0.05). Relative risk of O/O was increased if the child was postpubertal
(OR=3.47, p&lt;0.05) or if the child had a moderate diet diversity (OR=4.97, p&lt;0.1).
Conclusion: Both U/O and O/O double burden households are present in this sample.
Longitudinal data suggests under- and overweight among children in this cohort are both
increasing. Indicators for either type of household imply that social and physiological factors
may be involved, but more research is required to better define these pathways. In the
meantime, nutrition intervention programmes must recognise the existence of both extremes of
malnutrition at population and household level, and incorporate this into their targeting
strategies in order to manage the dual burden of malnutrition effectively. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description> Using both qualitative and quantitative data, this paper examines the changing educational and occupational aspirations and educational achievements of children living in poor communities in Ethiopia. The results suggest that children had high aspirations at an earlier age but that these changed later, with poverty rarely influencing their earlier aspirations but having a strong impact later on. Children with high educational achievement, mostly urban children and some rural girls, maintained their high ambitions. Education policy imposed constraints and provided varied opportunities for rural and urban children that affected their educational achievement and aspirations. Educational achievement was influenced by age of entry to school and continued attendance. Government development programmes and agricultural livelihoods attracted rural children’s labour and thereby negatively affected their education and realisation of their ambitions. The longitudinal data suggest that some children have begun considering out-of-school transitions (e.g. girls’ early marriage and full-time work for girls and boys) and, as a consequence, it seems that very few poor children will be able to realise their ambitions. </dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Objective: To compare differences in child nutritional status and the prevalence of wasting, stunting, and underweight between the new World Health Organization (WHO) standards based on healthy optimally fed children from different cultures and the international National Centre for Health Statistics (NCHS)/WHO references using empirical data from the first round of a longitudinal panel study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Materials and Methods: Three cross-sectional data sets from the Young Lives longitudinal study were analysed from India (Andhra Pradesh state), Peru, and Vietnam. Around 2000, children between 6 and 17.9 months old from each country were weighed and measured. Mean z scores for weight-for-length, weight-for-age, and length-for-age-and the prevalence of wasting, stunting, and underweight-were calculated using the new WHO growth standards and compared with the results calculated using NCHS/WHO references.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Results: Compared with the NCHS reference, the mean weight-for-length and weight-for-age z scores for all countries were higher, and the mean length-for-age z scores were similar, using the WHO standards. The mean z score for weight-for-age was closer to zero, compared with NCHS, in all 3 countries, indicating that the WHO standard curves better reflect the pattern of ponderal growth in these populations. Using WHO standards, wasting was more prevalent in India and Peru but less prevalent in Vietnam. In all 3 countries a higher proportion of children were stunted and fewer children classified as underweight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Conclusions: Using the new WHO standards resulted in differences in mean z scores for weight-for-length and weight-for-age and changes in the prevalence of wasting, stunting, and underweight. The direction and magnitude of difference are not consistent.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Government, non-government and donor organisations have developed a social assistance programme known as the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) which has two subprogrammes, namely the Public Work Programme (PWP) and Direct Support Programme (DSP). PSNP is designed to reduce the vulnerability of poor people to drought. It targets households in most cases without considering ex ante the issue of intra-household resource distribution. This paper assesses, using Young Lives survey data, the impacts of PSNP and Agricultural Extension Programme (AEP) on time use between work and schooling, as well as the highest grade completed by 12-year-old children in rural and urban Ethiopia. Empirically the study used propensity score matching techniques to estimate the impact of PSNP and AEP on child welfare measured by time use in various types of work, schooling and studying. We found that PWP in rural areas increases child work for pay; reduces children's time spent on child care, household chores and total hours spent on all kind of work combined; and increases girls spending on studying. The DSP in rural and urban areas reduces time children spent on paid and unpaid work, and increases the highest grade completed by boys in urban areas. On the other hand, AEP in rural areas was effective in reducing child work for pay and total work, increasing time girls spent on schooling and the highest grade completed by girls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A separate 1-page Research Summary, which presents the main findings and policy implications of the Working Paper in easily understood language, is also attached.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ As one of the poorest countries in the world, Ethiopia's rate of child malnutrition is one of the highest, even within sub&amp;#8209;Sahara Africa. The causes and relative importance of various determinants of malnutrition in Ethiopia are not well understood. This paper specifically explores some of the less obvious factors affecting children's nutritional status in Ethiopia. It is based on information collected in 2002 from 1001 households with eight-year-old children mainly from food insecure communities in Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, SNNP and Addis Ababa Regional States. As part of the Young Lives Project, this study is particularly important because the determinants of the nutritional status of eight&amp;#8209;year&amp;#8209;old children is much less researched than that of younger children, not only in Ethiopia but in other developing countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results show that weight&amp;#8209;for&amp;#8209;height z&amp;#8209;scores depend on the sex of the child and suggest that short&amp;#8209;term malnutrition is higher for male children than for female children. We conclude that variables such as physical and natural capital (wealth index, ownership of radio, television and land), human capital (education of members of the household), social capital (strength of a caregivers' ties to social organizations and networks), age&amp;#8209;sex composition of households (the number of girls, the number of female adults) and location of residence (rural or urban) are important in influencing WHZ in eight&amp;#8209;year&amp;#8209;olds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We conclude that addressing child malnutrition, especially WHZ, requires a multi&amp;#8209;dimensional
approach that takes into account food security, public health and gendered intra&amp;#8209;household dynamics if it is to be effective. Moreover, a cross&amp;#8209;sectoral nutrition policy is needed to improve policy synergies. ]]></dc:description>

qualitative methods carried out in April 2006 in Peru. The aim of the pilot study was to
test a series of methods that could be developed for use in the newly established qualitative
component of Young Lives, beginning with a first round of longitudinal qualitative data
gathering which would involve a sub-sample of the two cohorts of Young Lives children.
The methods were identified through an extensive review of literature detailing participatory,
quantitative and qualitative work with children and adults and developed for specific age
groups and research questions. The research investigated four inter-related themes:
children's time use, wellbeing, understandings of poverty and their social worlds. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description> Social protection measures are becoming an increasingly important policy tool for African governments. These measures have important potential for reducing poverty and positive impacts on child well-being. However, Young Lives research has found that different social protection programmes in Ethiopia have had unexpected impacts on girls' and boys' participation in school, and in paid and unpaid work. In order to create a win-win situation where both national economic development and children's rights are realised, it is crucial to have a deeper understanding of the relationship between social protection programmes and children's time use. </dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This literature review aims to revisit some research materials and relevant documents
regarding children in Ethiopia. As the purpose is to provide context for the ongoing qualitative
research component of the Young Lives project, this review will focus on the themes of
children’s key transitions (in education and work) and well-being (in terms of the physical,
psychological, social and economic aspects of children’s lives). There is currently very little
data on these themes, and research in which children are the main source of data is almost
nonexistent. For this reason our search strategy is not recorded here, as it essentially
involved reviewing every written document we were able to obtain about children in Ethiopia.
Some studies were fragmented, the use of adults as respondents overshadowed children’s
voices, and quantitative survey methods outnumbered in-depth qualitative studies, although
Woodhead (2001) and Poluha (2007a) are notable exceptions to these trends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The rest of the literature review is organised as follows: part two focuses on the key
transitions in education and work; part three briefly reviews literature on ill/well-being,
focusing on health risks and harmful traditional practices; part four sets out the implications of
the literature review for the Young Lives qualitative research in Ethiopia; part five provides
some brief concluding remarks. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description> India was a relatively late reformer. It was only in 1991 that a consistent liberalisation and reform programme was introduced. This paper investigates the effects of these macroeconomic and policy changes on the welfare of children in India generally, and in Andhra Pradesh, an actively reforming State in south India, in particular. Since it is impossible to identify clear and uniform causal relationships between policy changes and child welfare, the paper discusses a number of mechanisms through which reforms could have an impact on the rights and capabilities of children in India. These mechanisms are of four different kinds: a) some sectoral policies may have a direct effect on children's rights and capabilities; b) economic policy changes may affect household livelihoods, and thereby indirectly the welfare of children in these households; c) some policies are likely to have an effect on the wider administrative and economic conditions (systems of governance, availability of government funds, etc.), which may impinge on the quality of government services and on child welfare; and d) the reforms may influence social norms, lifestyles and aspirations of people, with consequences for child welfare. Each of these mechanisms is elaborated, and several hypotheses linking reforms with welfare of children are discussed. The paper ends with some suggestions for further research. </dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ The potential of quality early childhood care and education (ECCE) to transform young lives is increasingly recognised. The challenge now is to realise this potential in practice. This paper asks about the everyday experiences of early education of children in Ethiopia, India and Peru, based on a sample of 2,000 children in each of the three countries. It discusses issues of access and quality in both urban and rural settings, in contexts where government programmes are well established as well as in contexts where the private sector dominates. The paper explores both children's and their parents' views of local pre-schools and how this affects the choices families make around starting school. It also looks at how children make the key transition from pre-school into primary school. Studying experiences and perspectives of the Young Lives children and their parents makes it possible to examine to what extent promises made for early childhood are being translated into practice in terms of accessible, equitable, quality programmes and services.

   <dc:title>Young Lives. An international study of childhood poverty. Overall summary findings.</dc:title>
   <dc:description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;Young Lives is a long-term international research project investigating the changing nature of childhood poverty in four developing countries - Ethiopia, Peru, India (Andhra Pradesh) and Vietnam - over 15 years. The project is following two groups of children in each country: 2000 children who were born in 2001/2 and 1000
children who were born in 1994/5. Data have been collected from two rounds of research, in 2002 and
2006/7. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings summarized in this report come from the country reports of the second round of quantitative research. At present the research results are still preliminary, but they will be added to by qualitative research over the coming months. This will help to build a detailed picture of what is actually happening to children growing up in different households, communities, and localities in each country. Findings across the countries are discussed in relation to poverty and intergenerational transmission of poverty, nutrition, access to services, education, child work, ethnicity and gender, and subjective well-being. Policy implications are briefly noted.&lt;/p&gt; ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:title>Working Paper 27. Child Learning in Andhra Pradesh: The interplay between school and home.</dc:title>
   <dc:date>2005-01-01T00:00:00</dc:date>
   <dc:description><![CDATA[ India has seen remarkable progress over the past 50 years in both adult literacy and school enrolment for boys and girls. However, there are concerns about drop-out rates and the quality of education, especially in public schools. Children learn both within and outside the classroom. There is a need to understand the extent to which child learning outcomes (such as basic numeracy and literacy skills) are influenced by the home environment. If parents and communities are to play a role in compensating for the low quality of public schooling, it is important to consider how policy initiatives can best take into account and support the complementary role of families and
communities in the educational process. What would be the most effective and equitable approach to education policies and programmes - targeting schools, or parents (by means of income supplementation or adult literacy programmes), or both?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Andhra Pradesh (AP) state has achieved considerable economic progress but, nevertheless, lags in terms of social
indicators such as schooling and literacy of females. We use data from the Young Lives study to explore patterns of learning outcomes among eight-year old children in AP (N=1008). The paper aims to explore the issues related to child learning in public and private schools and the role of household level factors such as parental education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key findings are that children in private schools have better literacy and numeracy skills regardless, of wealth or caste, than children in public schools. Children with uneducated parents (especially mothers) are at a disadvantage. This disadvantage is greater in public schools than in private schools. Girls have lower learning scores than boys. There is a clear interplay between school and home. The effect of caregiver's education on child learning is greater
for those attending public schools than private ones. The results reinforce previous findings about the role of parental factors, and provide insights into aspects of education reform that are necessary to improve the quality of public schooling. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Building on recent advances in the literature and using a rich data set for two cohorts of children aged between one and twelve for Andhra Pradesh, India, we investigate the determinants of children's cognitive as well as non-cognitive skills. We find evidence of self-productivity for cognitive skills and cross-productivity effects from cognitive on non-cognitive skills. Moreover, we demonstrate that parental investment has contemporaneously powerful positive effects on skill levels for all age groups. Investigating other determinants of these skills, we find child health at age one to influence cognitive abilities at age five, whilst child health at age one is influenced by parental care already during pregnancy and earliest childhood. Understanding the determinants which account explicitly for the effects of a large
number of child, caregiver and household characteristics provides insights with regard to possible policy interventions to improve the chances of children in poor environments of developing cognitive and non-cognitive skills crucial for success in many spheres of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A separate 1-page Research Summary, which presents the main findings and policy implications of the Working Paper in easily understood language, is also attached.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ The Young Lives international conference gathered together 150 participants from over 25 countries for 3 days of vibrant discussion and debate on the causes and consequences of childhood poverty, food for thought and new insights. The conference explored the importance of a longitudinal perspective for highlighting how the many dimensions of childhood poverty interact, showing how children and families on the margins move in and out of poverty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Themes included:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
1)    Dimensions and dynamics of childhood poverty&lt;br/&gt;
2)    Breaking the cycle of poverty&lt;br/&gt;
3)    Innovations in methodology for research and policy influence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting report summarises the presentations and discussions at the conference. A 10 minute Quicktime video shows participants reflecting on the key challenges in tackling childhood poverty. Selected profiles of Young Lives children and pictures from the project photos exhibition can be viewed on-line at The Guardian: a link is attached together with the document links.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ The paper presents and discusses the findings of a study on families' and teachers' understanding
of parental involvement in children's schooling in public primary schools in Peru. The study was
undertaken against a background of encouragement of parental participation in education as a
means to democratise and improve the quality of educational services. In Peru, as elsewhere, parental
involvement in schooling is increasingly seen as contributing to learning and achievement. A sample
of 16 children in four departments of Peru was interviewed, together with their teachers and parents.
Researchers found parents have limited knowledge about how learning takes place in schools and how
they can support their children. Hardly any schools have strategies to guide parental involvement in
schooling. Understanding of learning is especially inadequate among poorer and less-educated families.
The authors draw the attention of policy-makers to the need to develop better strategies to shape and
promote parental involvement in ways that might help enhance children's learning and achievement. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This paper was prepared by Joy Johnston in January 2006, when Young Lives was at
a turning point. Detailed planning was underway for the second round of data collection
for the two cohorts - approximately 2,000 children aged between 6-17.9 months in 2002
and 1,000 children aged between 7.5-8.5 years in 2002 in each study country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This paper focuses on the methods, tools, and instruments that may be useful for research
with children in the second and subsequent phases of data collection in the Young Lives
project. Specifically, it addresses methods for investigating the following two lines of
enquiry:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
a) What are the factors (global, national, sub-national, community and
household/family) that act on children's lives, to either increase or reduce
poverty and its effects?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
b) What effects do multidimensional aspects of poverty have on children's
functioning, capabilities and well-being during the course of childhood?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The paper includes examples of qualitative and quantitative measures that could be
used both in sub-sample and full-sample data collection. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ The potential of quality early childhood and primary education to help break inter-generational poverty cycles is widely
recognised. My focus is on how far this potential is being translated into reality, through implementing positive early
childhood policies in practice. The paper summarises evidence from Young Lives research into early transitions, based
on both survey and in-depth qualitative research with 2,000 Young Lives younger cohort children in Ethiopia, Andhra
Pradesh (India) and Peru. Primary education is still being consolidated in Ethiopia, and pre-school is a minority urban
experience, mainly offered by the private sector. Peru offers a very different story, with a well-established government
primary and pre-school system but concerns about quality and coordination between sectors. Andhra Pradesh offers
the most complex set of challenges, with a long-established government system of ECCE, but an increasing trend
towards use of private services, including amongst the poorest communities. The paper offers five broad conclusions,
about the importance of: ensuring quality and equity in early education; better coordinated pre-school and school
systems; targeting the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children; recognising the full range of equity issues; and
ensuring more effective governance, including governance of the private sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A separate 1-page Research Summary, which presents the main findings and policy implications of the Working Paper in easily understood language, is also attached. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This paper explores efforts to bridge multi&amp;#8209;disciplinary research, policy engagement and practice to improve poor children's life quality in four diverse transforming societies. It draws on Young Lives (2000&amp;#8209;2015), an international longitudinal policy&amp;#8209;research project on childhood poverty, tracing 12,000 children (8,000 from birth and 4,000 from age eight) in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam. Beginning with a discussion about the importance of mapping the policy context, it supports reconceptualising policy&amp;#8209;making as a non&amp;#8209;linear dynamic process involving multiple actor networks with varying interests and informed by competing policy narratives (local and global). It suggests that opportunities for influencing policy are more varied, but perhaps also narrower and more incremental than conventionally perceived. This is particularly important in under&amp;#8209;researched polities at different stages in democratisation, decentralisation, and economic development processes, and that Northern&amp;#8209;derived models of advocacy are likely to be context&amp;#8209;inappropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The paper then draws on Young Lives (YL) experiences to identify common factors that either contributed to or thwarted evidence&amp;#8209;based pro&amp;#8209;poor child&amp;#8209;focused change. It focuses in particular on three key aspects: partnership and networking, framing of messages and dissemination/communication
methodologies. The concluding section reflects on the particular challenges involved when promoting children's (rather than other vulnerable groups') rights, including children's limited voice in the social and political arena, the dearth of state and civil society champions of children's rights, a limited evidence base to establish macro&amp;#8209;micro policy linkages, and the tendency for children's issues to be limited to health and education policies. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description> The past few decades have witnessed international pressure to get more children in the world educated, for longer. The view that school education is core to definitions of good childhoods and successful youth transitions is increasingly widespread, globally and locally. However, structural inequalities persist and migration for education has become an important individual, family and community response to overcome these gaps. This article explores the relationship between migration and educational aspirations among a group of young people participating in Young Lives, an international study of child poverty, in Peru. It draws on survey and qualitative data collected on a cohort of children being tracked by the study over a 15-year period, from the time they were 8 years old (2002) into early adulthood (2017). Young people and their parents connect migration with the process of 'becoming somebody in life' and with their high educational aspirations. This is linked to intergenerational dependencies and the roles that children play in mitigating family poverty. Their aspirations are generated against a country backdrop of economic and social inequalities, a recent history of political violence and resulting mass displacement, and established and diverse patterns of internal and international migration. </dc:description>

   <dc:title>The Effect of Maternal Education and Maternal Mental Health on Child’s Growth</dc:title>
   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Background: child growth is recognised internationally as the best global indicator of
physical well-being in children. This study identifies the main factors associated with
trajectory of child’s growth among poor children in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India, with
specific focus on the effects of maternal education and maternal mental health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Materials and method: data from two consecutive rounds of the Young Lives cohort study
were individually linked to obtain continuous measures of child growth between the ages of
1 and 5: a) increase in child’s height (in centimetres) and b) increase in child’s weight (in
kilograms). Each measure was analysed using linear regression to estimate the effects of
maternal education, maternal mental health and other factors on child’s growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Results: simple regression found increases in height and weight to be positively associated
with maternal education and maternal mental health. Associations were also observed with
child’s gender, maternal height, weight and caste, paternal education, household wealth
index and debt, type of setting (urban versus rural) and region (agro-climatic). Multiple
regressions revealed increases in child’s height and weight to be independently associated
with child’s gender, maternal height and weight, household wealth index and region but not
with maternal education and maternal mental health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Conclusion: this study illustrates the pivotal role of a prospective design in identifying key
factors affecting increases in child’s height and weight. Neither key factors of prior interest
examined - maternal education or maternal mental health - was found to be associated with
child growth independent of other factors identified. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Based on ethnographic research among Kinh, Hmong and Cham H’Roi children in the highlands of Vietnam in 2008, this paper presents a narrative analysis of how poverty and ethnicity affect children’s experience of adversity. It explores the meanings children give to their experience and their use of discursive strategies such as criticising displays of wealth to create a repertoire of meanings from which personal and collective resilience is drawn. Acknowledging the ambiguities and contradictions in children’s accounts, the author reflects on how their understanding of social differences is underpinned by local power structures.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This paper examines the impact of climatic shocks on young children's nutritional
indicators, using the Peruvian Young Lives project data set. Special attention is given to
child nutrition and climatic shocks, since malnutrition in young children may have long-term
negative effects, and the covariate nature of climatic shocks and natural disasters may make them more
difficult to cope with than other shocks. This paper finds that climatic shocks led to a
significant increase in child stunting, reducing the height-for-age z-score of five-year-old
children by 10%. This evidence suggests that climatic shocks may have a permanent
effect on health, affecting children's ability to acquire cognitive and non-cognitive
skills. This paper also contributes to the literature by finding that the negative impact of
climatic shocks on child nutrition can be offset by executing risk-coping strategies. Yet,
Government aid seems irrelevant in offsetting such negative effects. These findings
suggest that it might be pertinent to change the focus of government policies, from
direct actions, to the improvement of household risk-coping capacities and abilities. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Monitoring, protecting and promoting 'well-being' are central to realisation of children's rights.
Yet definitions of the concept are both variable and can appear conceptually confused.
Competing research paradigms engage with the concept and its measurement, while
applications of well-being in policy are equally contested. This paper outlines some of the
major debates, as a starting point for reviewing three contrasting approaches to well-being:
indicator-based, participatory and longitudinal research. In particular, it focuses on
applications of the concept in contexts of child poverty worldwide. We suggest there are
some promising signs of integration amongst these approaches, and argue that well-being
does have potential as a bridging concept, at the same time highlighting inequalities,
acknowledging diversities, and respecting children's agency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing on the experience of Young Lives, a 15-year, four-country longitudinal study of child
poverty, we suggest that methods for studying child well-being in global contexts should be
dynamic and sensitive to culture and time, as well as to the trade-offs that children are
required to make between themselves and others. We argue that dynamic approaches are
especially important in research with children as they address how people change in time.
Well-being is understood by Young Lives to be about real people and the social contexts they
inhabit. It can act as a lens - similar to culture - which recognises that outcomes of
deprivation are influenced by children and their responses to and interpretation of events.
Accessing children's views in the context of their communities is important and can increase
the accuracy and credibility of research data. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Although enrolment in primary schools in Peru is very high, more than half of primary school children are one or more grades below the norm for their age. Furthermore, evaluations have shown that, when tested, Peruvian school children score well below the norms expected for their age. Their scores are
also below the average levels of countries with similar socio-economic circumstances. The role of social capital in explaining these findings has not been studied, although research in the USA has suggested positive associations between social capital and educational achievement. Social organisations that focus
on childcare are one example of strong community networking resources in Peru. The Young Lives study offers an opportunity to investigate whether social capital is associated with educational progress and achievement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the study confirmed poor educational outcomes for many Peruvian school children. High proportions were unable to master simple tasks and were in a lower school grade than they
should have been for their age group. There is a clear negative association between educational achievement and poverty. Overall, rural students are poorer and are thus more prone to low
achievement (lower results in tests) and falling behind their expected grade. However, there seem to be no significant differences between boys and girls in these outcomes. The results do not support the hypothesis of a positive association between the social capital available to the family and the educational outcomes of their children, except for the association between cognitive social capital (at the community level) and children being in the correct grade for their age. This means that communities which experience more quality in their social relationships (eg trust) are more likely to have children who are in the correct school grade for their age. This result applies to how children are progressing at school (whether they are in the correct grade for their age) but does not extend to
children's achievement (results in tests). ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:date>2009-01-01T00:00:00</dc:date>
   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This paper focuses on children's understandings of well-being and ill-being in resource-poor contexts in Ethiopia, using quantitative and qualitative data collected from individuals and groups. The quantitative data are drawn from Young Lives child questionnaire, which was administered to children aged 11 to 12 across 20 sentinel sites in Ethiopia during 2006. The qualitative data come from group activities with a sub-sample of these children in five communities and individual interviews that build on these activities (the data presented here focus on an urban, a remote rural, and a near rural community). Having established the importance of considering children's understandings of well-being and described some of the methods used, the paper addresses two questions. Firstly, how understandings of a good life and what is needed to achieve this differ between different types of community and social group. Secondly, how the relationship between well-being and education articulated in the group activities is expressed in the biographies of individual children, drawing on the examples of a twelve-year-old girl and boy from the remote rural site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A separate 1-page Research Summary, which presents the main findings and policy implications of the Working Paper, is also attached.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Building on recent advances in the literature and using a rich data set for two cohorts of children aged between one and twelve for Andhra Pradesh, India, we investigate the determinants of children's cognitive as well as non-cognitive skills. We find evidence of self-productivity for cognitive skills and cross-productivity effects from cognitive on non-cognitive skills. Moreover, we demonstrate that parental investment has contemporaneously positive effects on skill levels for all age groups. Investigating other determinants of these skills, we find child health at age one to influence cognitive abilities at age five, whilst child health at age one is influenced by parental care already during pregnancy and earliest childhood. Understanding the determinants which account explicitly for the effect of a large number of child, caregiver and household characteristics provides insights with regard to possible policy interventions to improve the chances of children in poor environments of developing cognitive and non-cognitive skills crucial for success in many spheres of life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;Data and documentation for Round 1 of the Young Lives survey have been updated, and data and documentation for Round 2 have been added to the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Round 1:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This dataset comprises the baseline household surveys for the main sample of one-year-old and eight-year-old children. For each country, two files are included at the household and child level for both ages. The data for the older children also include information from the child questionnaire. In addition, several files are included at lower levels (i.e. where there are several records per household). These include the household roster and activity schedules for livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topics covered include: household composition; child health; caregiver background; livelihoods; economic changes; socio-economic status; social capital and anthropometry. In addition, the information gathered for younger children also includes details from the caregiver on pregnancy, delivery, breastfeeding, mental health, and child care. Topics specific to the older eight-year-olds survey include child's schooling and work; child mental health (not available for Peru or Ethiopia), and child development.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Round 2:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This dataset comprises the data from the five-year-olds and twelve-year-olds household surveys and the twelve-year-olds child survey carried out in 2006. For each of the four countries the dataset contains two files at the household/child level (one for the five-year-olds survey and one for the twelve-year-olds survey). The household/child level data file for the twelve-year-olds survey also includes data from the child questionnaire. In addition there are several files at lower levels (i.e. where there are several records per household). These include the household roster and activity schedules for livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topics covered in the dataset include: parental background; household education; livelihoods and asset framework; household food and non-food consumption and expenditure; social capital, economic changes and recent life history; socio-economic status; child care, education and activities; child health; anthropometry; caregivers perceptions and attitudes; school and activities, child time use; social networks, social skills and social support; feelings and attitudes; parents and household issues; child development; perception of the future, environment and household wealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Round 1 and 2 also include calculated indices such as a wealth index, various social capital scores, and mental health scores, which are all detailed in the documentation. The SPSS syntax code files that show methods of calculation for the composite indices are also included in the dataset.&lt;/p&gt; 

The datasets can be accessed from the &lt;a href="http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/findingData/snDescription.asp?sn=5307"target=_blank"&gt;ESDS website&lt;/a&gt; by following study number 5307. Associated documentation is also available on the website.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This paper uses Young Lives (YL) data to explore the interaction of private assets, such as education, with public services, some of them provided at the community level and some of them at the household level. In particular, we have explored how mother's education interacts with access to clean water and sewerage, availability and quality of health facilities, proximity to paved or engineered roads, and access to electricity. Using cross tabulations between these variables and anthropometric outcomes, and regression analyses that account for the clustered nature of the data, the paper focuses on the direct and indirect impact of maternal education on height-for-age z-scores (HAZ), after controlling for other covariates including inherited factors, family and child characteristics, and community characteristics, some of which can be influenced by public policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in many other studies, mother's education was found to have a positive effect on long-term nutritional status, as measured by HAZ. HAZ is clearly associated with mother's education and the data suggest a non-linear relationship, ie, more important in earlier years. The results clearly establish that mother's education is an important independent determinant of child nutritional status. Moreover, there are indirect effects of education operating through other variables such as the number and spacing of siblings and initial birth weight. An auxiliary regression that only includes education shows that at least half the effect of education is direct, while the remainder operates through wealth and family demographics. In addition, the level of mothers' education at the community level also matters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Differences in nutritional status according to service access are seen in both urban and rural areas. Only in the case of those mothers who are more educated does access to services not make a significant difference to nutritional status. These findings are maintained when covariates are controlled for. Although these are only cross correlations, they suggest potential substitutability between education - a private asset - and public service facilities, the availability of which depends, even if they are inside the household, on the existence of a public network. Our results thus endorse the concept that investment in public services is even more necessary in areas with low maternal education. ]]></dc:description>

mainly presented for the entire age group cohort, in most cases separated into wealth groups or by rural/urban location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the introduction, the next section of the report introduces the socio-economic context of Vietnam and the policies that have affected children and childhood poverty over the past 15 years. The third section gives an overview of the methodology used by Young Lives to collect quantitative data for Rounds 1 and 2 respectively. Greater detail is provided on the preparation and
implementation of the Round 2 data collection. Post-fieldwork operations such as data entering, cleaning, and archiving are also outlined. The fourth section presents some preliminary analysis of data from the two survey rounds - both descriptive statistics and regression analysis - on several issues of interest. Indicators of child well-being including household wealth and consumption, health, education and subjective well-being are examined. The factors behind these outcomes include a range of child, household and commune characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the analysis is preliminary it gives important insights into trends between the two
rounds, key factors affecting children in Vietnam and the extent of inequalities between children of different groups. The analysis enables the identification of policy implications for tackling childhood poverty in Vietnam as well as important and interesting avenues for future research.&lt;/p&gt; ]]></dc:description>

Evidence Has on Policy?
The Role of Politics in
Research Utilisation.]]></dc:title>
   <dc:description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;What shapes the influence evidence has on policy? The key lesson that emerges
from this paper is the primacy of politics in shaping how evidence is used. In
order to influence the policy process, the research community must understand
both the technocratic and the political aspects of policymaking, and how these
shape the choices and incentives of policy elites. The paper proposes guidelines
for integrating political economy analysis into different stages of the research
and communication process. It addresses three main questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the assumptions behind and problems with the concept of
    evidence-based policy and what can be learnt from this?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What prevents the effective utilisation of research in policymaking?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How can we put into practice what we know about the role of politics in
    shaping how evidence is used?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper draws on some examples from Young Lives, a longitudinal study of
childhood poverty in Ethiopia, India, Vietnam and Peru, and contains case
studies of how researchers engaged with policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <dc:description> The paper explores the perspectives of caregivers and other adults on the nature and timing of childhood transitions, elicited through group discussions in five Ethiopian communities, as reflective of the community norms that shape childhood transitions. The paper uses data from Young Lives, a longitudinal study of children growing up in poverty, to investigate the transitions made by girls from childhood to the onset of puberty. It argues that these transitions are rarely linear, singular, or focused on 'learning', but instead multiple and often contradictory. While girls are said to be constrained by lack of opportunities, the main constraint to successful transitions in the communities discussed in the paper is having too many potentially contradictory opportunities, too soon. </dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This paper sets out the key findings from Young Lives research into the ways that major social
protection policies are impacting on children, their families and communities in Ethiopia,
India and Peru. The research is based on information collected about children,
their households and communities since 2001. Two cohorts of children in each country have
been followed since the age of 1 and 8 years; three quantitative surveys and two rounds of
qualitative fieldwork have taken place in each country. Sub-studies also include qualitative
fieldwork and analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the conclusion the authors draw out a series of key policy relevant
conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Well designed social protection has a major role in improving children's
    life chances.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are however risks of unintended consequences within social
    protection, and it is important therefore that policymakers consider
    carefully the possible effects on children.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Social protection and cash transfers can have important intra-household
    and gendered effects which should be considered within policy design.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Despite the size of the social protection schemes in Young Lives
    countries, considerable numbers of poor children are not covered.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Schemes usually contain some form of conditionality. Policymakers need to
    carefully consider the impacts of particular conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Social protection schemes operate in a context, and policymakers need to
    consider both the scheme itself and how other economic and social policies
    are able to help families move beyond dependence on social protection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This report presents initial analysis of the first round of qualitative data collected between
September and November 2007 as part of the Young Lives study in Ethiopia. Data collection
was carried out in five of the twenty Young Lives study communities, with both cohorts of
children – the younger cohort (then aged between 6 and 7 years) and the older cohort (ages 12
to 13) – as well as their caregivers, teachers, health workers, and community representatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The qualitative research entailed a mix of methods to generate data on the themes of
transitions, well-being and services including individual interviews with children, caregivers
and teachers, and group interviews with children (both cohorts) as well as with adults in the
community. Creative methods such as drawing and self-report diaries were used as a basis
for discussions with children on key research themes. Semi-structured observations of
homes, schools and community settings provided the context for analysing and
understanding the data. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Although there are now several instruments available to measure social capital in a quantitative manner, very few of them have been validated, and no published study has examined respondents' interpretation of the meaning of the questions. This article represents one of the first attempts to measure the validity of a quantitative social capital instrument. Young Lives is a study that includes quantitative measures of caregivers' social capital using the Short Adapted Social Capital Assessment Tool (Short A-SCAT). Vietnamese respondents' interpretations of questions on social capital were compared to the original intended meaning of the questions and to fieldworkers' interpretations. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with two interpreters who were involved in translating the original questionnaire from English to Vietnamese, two supervisors and six interviewers. In-depth interviews were conducted with 24 female caregivers similar to the original respondents. Key concepts in social capital, like trust and sense of belonging, were interpreted similarly by all actors. Support was perceived narrowly by caregivers (limited to money and goods). Most problems arose from changes originating from translation from English to Vietnamese and by the changing nature of local political structures and how one refers to them. Overall validity appeared fairly high with a "correct interpretation" rate of 77 percent. There is now a valid tool for quickly and cheaply assessing social capital in a quantitative manner in Vietnam.

It tests for association between taking extra classes and learning outcomes (numeracy, reading and writing skills).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forty-six per cent of children in the Young Lives sites took extra classes - mainly (over 60 per cent) at the instigation of their parents. On average children attended extra classes for nine hours a week, with 90 per cent of those taking extra classes exceeding the legal limit of four hours a week. Thirty per cent of household education expenses was devoted to extra classes. The main factors associated with good
learning outcomes were: household wealth; having educated parents; being from the majority ethnic group; and having good child mental health. Extra classes did not affect writing or numeracy but were linked with increased reading ability. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ It is well established that mothers' education has positive effects on child nutrition in
developing countries. In school, girls can acquire skills which are later used to access
modern health services and comprehend health messages. Less explored, however, is
the effect exerted by the education of other individuals – the mothers' friends,
neighbours and family – which may influence child nutrition directly or modify the
effect of maternal education. Furthermore, questions remain about the mechanisms
underlying the adult education–child nutrition relationship, especially the role of
mothers' health and nutrition (HN) knowledge which has been debated in recent
literature. Future research into the impact of adult education on child nutrition should
therefore widen the focus from mothers only to others in her household, community and
communication network and specifically examine the mediating role of mothers' HN
knowledge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The thesis has two main components. In the first part,data collected in 2002
from the Young Lives (YL) study in Vietnam and Andhra Pradesh (AP) in India is analysed to
assess the association between child height- and weight-for-age z-scores and adult
education in the household and community. Adult education was measured as the level
of formal schooling completed and community-level education was measured by
aggregating individual-level data. Data were collected on 6019 households in 20 sites
and 133 communities with children aged either 1 or 8 years old.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second part of the thesis presents the results of a cross-sectional study undertaken
in 2004 of a sub-sample of YL mothers in AP, the Knowledge and Networks (KN)
study, which was designed to explore mediators of the education effect, specifically the
role of HN knowledge. Data were collected on the education, HN knowledge, general
awareness, media, communication ability and communication networks of 302 mothers.
Multi-level regression modelling in Stata and MLwiN is used to adjust simultaneously
for confounding and the hierarchical structure of the data-sets. The instrumental variable
approach was used in an attempt to adjust for 'endogeneity' of knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The thesis demonstrates the important role of education among 'influential others'
beyond the mother in determining child nutrition, thereby calling for a less
individualistic approach to research and policy. It concludes by
outlining key recommendations for future research which address both the
methodological weaknesses of the present study and the remaining knowledge gaps in
the literature. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;In each study country, Young Lives is following 2000 children who were born in 2001-2 and 1000 children who were born in 1994-5. The younger children are being tracked from infancy to their mid-teens and the older children to adulthood, when some will become parents themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report presents initial findings from the second round of data collection which was carried out in Vietnam in late 2006 to early 2007. It gives a broad outline of some of the key indicators of childhood poverty and changes that have taken place in the children's lives between the first
round of data collection in 2002 and this second round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summary comments on the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levels of absolute and relative poverty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Household factors that contribute to poverty (importance of parental education; ill-health; crop failure and other shocks)
&lt;li&gt;Access to services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nutrition&lt;/li&gt;	
&lt;li&gt;Education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethnicity and gender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subjective well-being&lt;/li&gt;

   <dc:description> This paper attempts to establish a link between micro-level outcomes and macro-level policy initiatives with respect to eight-year-old children's primary school enrolment in Ethiopia. The paper uses data from a 2002 survey of 1000 rural and urban households with eight-year-old children sampled from food insecure communities in Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, SNNP and Addis Ababa Regional States. Uusing a probit regression model, we investigated external factors associated with child enrolment in school (such as lack of income, child labour, economic shocks, social capital and education of adults in the household). We found that household wealth, cognitive social capital, adult education and ownership of land had a positive impact on whether our eight-year-old children were attending school. Household wealth had the strongest impact followed by cognitive social capital (perceived levels of trust and reciprocity), the maximum level of education attained by female adults in the household, ownership or rental of land, and the maximum level of education attained by male adults in the household. In contrast, child enrolment was found to be negatively associated with the number of household members over the age of 15 years, birth order, ownership of livestock, economic shocks, distance to primary school, and child labour, in declining magnitude. The findings in general suggest that increasing child enrolment in primary school, which is a commitment of the Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Program (SDPRP) and Education Sector Program (ESDP), will necessitate more targeted educational policies to address regional, gender and wealth disparities, the development of education programmes for adult caregivers, as well as broader inter-sectoral policy initiatives to ensure that policies in other sectors facilitate rather than hinder children's education (particularly credit and labour markets and infrastructure-related policies). </dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ The UN met in September 2010 to assess progress towards the Millennium Development
Goals. This paper aimed to inform the debate around achievement of the MDG Goals using evidence
and analysis from Young Lives. Young Lives first collected data in 2002 and is following two
cohorts of children. The youngest cohort of Young Lives children were born just after the new
millennium and are growing up with the promise of the MDGs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discuss descriptive and analytical evidence from the Young Lives sample,
within the scope of the MDGs, to elaborate four core arguments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, between 2002 and 2006 we observe evidence that national economic
    growth was associated with some limited gains in household wealth in the
    Young Lives sample. Despite this growth, significant inequalities are
    common. We also observe substantial positive increases in school enrolment
    and coverage of basic services.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Second, in some areas, for example enrolment, change looks quite
    progressive, with increases apparently benefiting previously excluded groups
    most, but: &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gaps often remain large and systematic. Groups weak within societies often
    do much less well than the majority or more affluent and powerful elites.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Process indicators only tell part of the story. A child's enrolment does
    not prove they attend school regularly, receive a decent education, or one
    which equips them with useful skills for later life.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Third, if the MDGs are to be transformational for children they need to
    help break the transmission of poverty between generations. At the moment we
    see clear evidence that poverty and inequalities restrict poorer children's
    life chances. Strategies to support sustained improvements under the MDGs
    need both to increase overall outcomes, and to deliver most for the poorest
    and most marginalised children.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fourth, averages are often used to measure change but can mask disparities
    between groups. Our evidence shows considerable differences . for instance
    in enrolment rates or access to services. It is important to expose such
    disparities to help understand how to improve outcomes for the poorest and
    most marginalised children.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <dc:title>The Impact of Child Labour on the Educational Achievement of Children in Vietnam.</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>A. Watson</dc:creator>
   <dc:description><![CDATA[ The incidence of child labour in the World today is very high, particularly in Third
World countries and an extensive literature exists on the causes of this phenomenon.
However there has been little investigation into the consequences of child labour on
socioeconomic outcomes of which the educational attainment of the children is one.
Using cross-section data for 12 year old children in Vietnam, collected by the Young
Lives team, this paper uses firstly OLS regressions and then an instrumental variable strategy to
evaluate the impact of child labour on the test scores of the sampled 12-year-olds in the
Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test which is used as a measure of their educational
attainment. A child labour variable is created by combining the total number of
hours in a typical day that the child spends caring for others, doing domestic tasks,
working for the family farm or business and working for pay outside of the household. Child labour does not have a significant impact on the test score results of the
children when village level fixed effects are included, and when child labour is
instrumented for using exogenous shocks to the household. The evidence suggests that
the short-term impact of child labour may be negligible although this only holds for the
relatively low levels of child labour undertaken by the Vietnamese children. Reducing
child labour will require households to be very forward-looking and to have access to
sufficient credit to fund the costs of schooling without requiring their children work. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ The sharp increase in food prices in the world market and in local markets since 2006 has raised serious concerns about the food and nutrition situation of poor families in many countries. Particularly in urban areas, where people cannot grow their own food, household budgets have been squeezed. The rapid price increases are particularly bad news for young children, as any disruption to their nutrition tends to have serious long-term implications, both in terms of growth and stunting and lower educational outcomes, affecting their earning potential in later life. This policy brief looks at longitudinal evidence from Young Lives to show how the food price crisis will have both short-term and long-term impacts on children's health and well-being. It also discusses policy options available to alleviate the consequences of the
present crisis on children.

   <dc:description> This paper explores children’s understandings of poverty, ill-being and well-being in Ethiopia using data collected through group exercises with children aged 5–6 and 11–13 participating in Young Lives, an international study of childhood poverty. In some respects the characteristics of poverty reported by children resemble those reported by adults participating in similar exercises. However, the children’s addition of appearance and clothing, and their explanations of the reasoning behind the importance of these indicators of well-being reflect growing inequalities in Ethiopia, where experiences of relative poverty and social exclusion are increasingly common. This evidence argues for broadening the focus of child poverty reduction to include the psychosocial costs of lacking the culturally specific resources required for full participation in society. The paper also illustrates ways in which poverty can be explored by asking about ill-being and that children as young as five years are able to address these themes through well-designed research methods. </dc:description>

   <dc:description> Many children younger than 5 years in developing countries are exposed to multiple risks, including poverty, malnutrition, poor health, and unstimulating home environments, which detrimentally affect their cognitive, motor, and social-emotional development. There are few national statistics on the development of young children in developing countries. We therefore identified two factors with available worldwide data—the prevalence of early childhood stunting and the number of people living in absolute poverty—to use as indicators of poor development. We show that both indicators are closely associated with poor cognitive and educational performance in children and use them to estimate that over 200 million children under 5 years are not fulfilling their developmental potential. Most of these children live in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. These disadvantaged children are likely to do poorly in school and subsequently have low incomes, high fertility, and provide poor care for their children, thus contributing to the intergenerational transmission of poverty. </dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This Working Paper includes two studies, the first one by Harpham, Huttly, Wilson and de Wet entitled 'Linking Public Issues with Private Troubles: Panel Studies in Developing Countries', the second by Hill on 'Reducing Attrition in Panel Studies in Developing Countries'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the first study are to identify challenges that arise in panel studies, and to give examples of how these have been addressed in
resource-constrained environments. The main issues considered are: the development of a conceptual framework which links macro and micro contexts; sampling the cohort in a cost-effective
way; tracking individuals; ethics and data management and analysis. Panel studies require long term funding, a stable institution and an acceptance that there will be limited value
for money in terms of results from early stages, with greater benefits accumulating in the study's mature years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In panel studies in developing countries, attrition or loss to follow-up is mostly due to respondents moving. Attrition can cause bias if it is selective, and efforts should be made to track respondents. This can be costly and difficult as populations in developing countries are often highly mobile, infrastructure is poor, structures frequently change and formal address systems and population records rarely exist. In the second part of this Working Paper, the experiences from panel studies in
developing countries are reviewed in terms of the importance of attrition, the importance of tracking respondents on reducing attrition and then makes recommendations for setting up
systems to track respondents in developing county settings. Tracking can reduce attrition by up to 45%, and is feasible if procedures are locally appropriate, well planned, involve the
community, collect as much locating data as possible, criteria are explicit, tracking is done and at regular intervals, and interviewers are well trained, supervised and motivated. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This paper uses Young Lives data collected on young families in Peru in 2002 and 2007. Young Lives have discovered that this demographic sample have a fairly high
propensity to migrate, and therefore it is interesting to examine the impact of these
movements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
We disaggregate migration into rural&amp;#8208;to&amp;#8208;urban, urban&amp;#8208;to&amp;#8208;rural, urban&amp;#8208;to&amp;#8208;urban and
rural&amp;#8208;to&amp;#8208;rural migration and compare the effects of these different natures of
migration on household wealth. Difference&amp;#8208;in&amp;#8208;differences and propensity score
matching are used to overcome the bias of time&amp;#8208;invariant unobservables, and
instrumental variables are used to address endogeneity caused by time&amp;#8208;variant
unobservables. We also look in more depth at why migrants moved, and the extent of
relocation costs, proxied by distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The paper aims to test the traditional theory of migration as an investment: That
households choose to migrate in order to gain net expected benefits, and that on
average they succeed in doing so. Our results for rural&amp;#8208;to&amp;#8208;urban migrant families
support this hypothesis. However, in our Peruvian data there is also a significant
number of families moving in the opposite direction, out of urban areas, and this
appears to be correlated with a general worsening in household wealth. The result
that even the average urban&amp;#8208;rural migrant family experiences a substantial decline in
wealth is inconsistent with the notion of migration as a rational choice, unless other,
perhaps more long&amp;#8208;term, benefits of urban&amp;#8208;rural migration outweigh the short&amp;#8208;term
deterioration in our wealth variable, or the counterfactual outcome of remaining in the
urban area was expected to have been even worse, due to an unobserved adverse
shock. We attempt to address the endogeneity raised by the latter case, by
instrumenting for urban&amp;#8208;rural migration using previous migration, but conclude that
this instrument may in fact serve to reinforce the argument of reverse causality; that
former migrants are more likely to suffer from adverse shocks, which 'push' them into
return migration. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;Despite the popularity of school meals as interventions in education, their effect on learning
and health outcomes is not clear. This study uses newly available longitudinal data from the
state of Andhra Pradesh in India to estimate these effects in a non-experimental setting. Further, it aims at disaggregating the average program impacts to see if some groups benefited more than the others i.e. whether heterogeneity in program impacts was present. We use changes in WHO anthropometric z scores as the outcome variables to evaluate impact on nutrition, and scores on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) to assess the impact on learning skills. The approach taken employs several different estimation strategies to correct for econometric issues in estimation; our preferred estimate for estimating health gains adopts an Instrumental Variables (IV) approach and for learning gains we use a difference-in-means estimator with propensity score matching methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find the scheme delivers non-trivial gains in both nutrition and learning which are highly
significant. The program acts as a security net for children, cushioning them from negative nutritional factors; in particular, among younger children, there are large and significant gains for children who suffered from the impact of drought. In cognitive skills, we find that school meals boost PPVT scores by over 0.6 s.d. Evidence presented here, combined with previous findings of gains in school participation in other studies, reaffirms the effectiveness of school meal programs in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt; ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ While the Ethiopian national emergency and food security programmes support farmers hit by area-wide shocks such as crop failure brought about by drought, insects and pests, idiosyncratic shocks such as illness and death of household member, loss of assets and separation of family or divorce are not covered by any of the current programmes. In the absence of social assistance programmes to support vulnerable households, these idiosyncratic shocks may lead to serious malnutrition among poor children. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using longitudinal data of children collected at the age of 1 and 5 years (Young Lives younger cohort data), we examined the existence of permanent consequences of early childhood malnutrition and recovery of children from their early childhood malnutrition plus the persistent effect of pre-natal and post-natal economic shocks on child health and nutritional achievement, as measured by z-score of height-for-age and log of height of 5-year-old children. We employed OLS, instrumental variable (IV) and generalised method of moment estimation methods controlling for community fixed effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Our results confirmed the existence of permanent consequences of early childhood malnutrition and also the potential for the strong recovery of children from their initial early malnutrition. We also found significant effects on zscore of height-for-age and log of height, not only for post-natal economic shock but also the pre-natal economic shocks, implying the long-term consequence of shocks on children’s height.In addition to area-wide shocks including crop failure brought about by drought, insects and pests, we found that idiosyncratic shocks such as separation of family, death of breadwinners and unavailability of food are also important determinants of malnutrition. Although area-wide economic shocks are very important and it would be good for the government to focus more on them, idiosyncratic shocks also have a considerable contribution to make to the improvement of children’s z-score of height-for-age and consequently to the reduction of stunting and severe stunting in Ethiopia. Therefore, it is still worthwhile to ensure that government assistance programmes cover idiosyncratic shocks such as death and illness of household members and separation of family or divorce. Also, since rural children are more vulnerable to economic shocks than urban children, it would be beneficial for social assistance programmes to focus more on rural areas. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:title>Young Lives Policy Brief 8. The Impact of the Midday Meal Scheme on Nutrition and Learning</dc:title>
   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Food insecurity and poor nutrition remain a problem in many developing countries and can have profound
effects on children’s health and their development. The Midday Meal Scheme in India is a programme covering
primary school children to improve nutrition as well as increase educational enrolment, retention and
attendance. This policy brief examines the effect of the scheme on nutrition (through testing height and weight)
and on children’s learning (through testing vocabulary).We find significant evidence of positive, protective
effects, particularly for children growing up in communities affected by drought, suggesting there are
substantial benefits of school feeding schemes for children’s learning and development. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ The calculation of income–poverty profiles should allow for household size and composition, but rarely does so. Failure to do this means that the poverty profile will be distorted. The appropriate adjustments are straightforward, requiring simple assumptions which, whilst arbitrary, are better than ignoring the problem. Not making these adjustments distorts not only the relationship between household size and poverty, but all aspects of the poverty profile correlated to household size. For the case of Vietnam, this article shows that, if the adjustments are not made, rural poverty is under–stated as is poverty amongst those with little education, minority ethnic groups and female–headed households. Far fewer children live in poverty than is suggested when the appropriate data adjustments are not made.

   <dc:title>Working Paper 20. Child Labour, Gender Inequality and Rural/Urban Disparities: how can Ethiopia's national development strategies be revised to address negative spill-over impacts on child education and well-being?</dc:title>
   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Drawing on a sample of 1999 households with at least one child aged 6 to 17 months in 2002, and from additional household data collected from 3115 children aged 7 to 17 years from twenty sentinel sites, the Young Lives Project sought to understand the impact on child labour and child schooling of public policy interventions formulated within the PRSP, and how changes are mediated through gender and rural&amp;#8209;urban differences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These were the key findings: children were commonly involved in fetching water, firewood and dung
both for household use and sale, although they were more likely to attend school when there was adequate household labour. School attendance was significantly lower in rural than in urban sites, while dropout rates were dramatically higher in rural areas. Maternal education levels significantly decreased the likelihood of children combining work and school. Increased land and livestock ownership led to a greater demand for child labour and reduced school enrolment. The involvement of households in more diversified activities increased the demand for labour which is frequently met by children, particularly boys, with girls commonly substituting for their mothers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of measrures to help reduce child labour and increase schooling are recommended. A separate 8-page Executive Summary is attached. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description> This short paper draws attention to the challenges of ensuring that early childhood programmes live up to their promise as a pro-poor strategy, faced with inequalities of access to quality programmes, and the implications in some countries of a growing private sector. This note draws on evidence from: (i) Round 2 of the Young Lives longitudinal survey (in 2006/7) involving 2,000 younger cohort children in each of the study countries (Peru, India, Vietnam and Ethiopia), aged 5-6 years, and focussing especially on issues of access, equity and quality. Qualitative studies have also been carried out with a sub-sample of children making the transition to primary school, drawing attention to the role of expanding and improving comprehensive early childhood care and education (ECCE; goal 1 of the Dakar Framework for Action), as a gateway to divergent (and unequal) pathways and outcomes. </dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ In this study, I examine the extent to which child labour is explained by the main determinants proposed in the literature. I focus on three determinants: income shocks, household composition and parental preferences. In addition, I examine the role of child-specific characteristics, such as psycho-social abilities and nutritional endowment. While there is extensive literature on child labour determinants, it is predominantly theoretical and tends to treat each determinant in isolation from the others. I use two rounds of data from the Young Lives project on a cohort of children living in Andhra Pradesh, India who were interviewed at the ages of 7 and then 11 to examine the effects of inter- and intra-household factors – as well as child-specific characteristics – on child labour in a unified empirical framework. I find that children work more in response to income shocks; that child labour is sensitive to household composition in terms of the age and gender of the other children; and, in urban areas, that it varies according to the bargaining power of women in the household. Investigation of child-specific fixed effects further suggests that nutritional status, reading skills and ability to get along with peers may also be relevant to whether and how much children work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A separate 1-page Research Summary, which presents the main findings and policy implications of the Working Paper in easily understood language, is also attached.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This paper presents the results of a Young Lives study into the impact and perceptions of the Programa Nacional Wawa Wasi, a Peruvian government programme for impoverished children aged six to 48 months. Up to eight children spend five days a week at a Wawa Wasi centre where they are assisted by a carer carefully selected from the local community. The results suggest that children who have spent at least six months at a centre have similar indicators in gross motor, language and fine motor development to children who have stayed at home. Interviews with several key actors indicated a positive outcome: centres are environments where children are kept safe and fed nutritious meals,freeing mothers of worries and enabling them to work or study. However, Wawa Wasi’s goal of improving children’s development is not sufficiently prioritised. There is a need for Wawa Wasi managers to strengthen early learning components of the programme, to enhance the skills of those who provide care and to recognise the dedication of paid carers and volunteers who have contributed to Wawa Wasi’s success.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ The MDGs have played a major role in focusing development policy since their original incarnation in the 1990s. Some development agencies, notably DFID, have gone as far as to judge their activities on the contribution to achieving the MDGs. What happens when we no longer have the MDGs? How will we promote pro-poor policy after 2015?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The High-level Policy Forum organised by DFID, ActionAid, DSA, EADI and IDS - in partnership with The Broker- took place on 23 June 2009 in Brussels, Belgium. This background paper was written by Young Lives Policy Manager, Caitlin Porter. It is suggested that the future needs to be about a more holistic understanding of child development, well-being and learning goals, and about a range of innovative models that can be accessed by all.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Social capital is broadly defined as the ‘value’ of social relationships. A substantial amount of work has been conducted into the role of social capital, but little of it has focused on Latin America and Peru in particular. Standard tools are often used to measure social capital in different cultural settings. We argue that while there are common themes, the exact nature of social capital is dependent upon the specific norms of behaviour, networks and organizations that characterize a given setting. Social capital is a multidimensional and culturally specific concept. The contribution that different organizations and networks make to different aspects of social capital varies by setting (rural/urban), person involved (male/female), and over time, highlighting the need for culturally sensitive measures. Two approaches are used to describe the characteristics of social capital in Peru: a literature review of research on social capital in Peru, and qualitative in-depth interviews with twenty respondents from one rural and two urban areas of Peru.

   <dc:title>Healthcare Choices in the Context of Reform: Perspectives of Young Lives Caregivers in Vietnam</dc:title>
   <dc:identifier>http://www.dfid.gov.uk/r4d/SearchResearchDatabase.asp?outputid=182591</dc:identifier>
   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Since the late 1980s, Vietnam has implemented market-based economic and healthcare
reforms, destabilizing the publicly funded healthcare that had gained international
renown. These reforms initiated substantial changes in healthcare provision and
financing, which involved the introduction of user fees, legalization of private practices,
and liberalization of pharmaceutical companies. In response to the impact of user fees
on equity of healthcare access, the government has introduced compensating measures
that aim to assist poor households and young children overcome new barriers to access.
Using existing qualitative data of caregivers within a sub-sample of Young Lives
Project participants, this study investigates the experiences and perceptions of
caregivers as they seek care in this mixed healthcare system of public and private
providers. Emphasis is placed on issues of quality and accessibility. Where do
caregivers take their children when they are sick? What are the important determinants
of health seeking behaviour within this sub-sample? This study finds that households,
regardless of poverty status, perceive quality and accessibility of care to be highest in
the private sector. Caregivers suggest that improvements in resources and quality of
care offered by the commune health clinic would influence their choice of care, if
quality could be guaranteed. This study also confirms gaps and inconsistencies in the
existing compensation measures, such as free care for the poor and for young children,
in their implementation and coverage. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ The Young Lives project in Vietnam allows the examination of
the relationship between maternal social capital and child well-being. With a sample of 1,953 mothers of one-year-olds and 954 mothers of eight-year-olds across five provinces, this study examines whether maternal social capital is associated with child health. This study found low levels of structural social capital (associational life) and citizenship and high levels of cognitive social capital (trust, etc) and support. While poorer women have even lower levels of structural social capital than their better-off peers, patterns across rural and urban areas are similar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maternal social support and high cognitive social capital show the most consistent associations with
child health, while associations between maternal social capital and child health are stronger among one-year-old children than among eight-year-olds, with the exception of child mental health and risk of life-threatening illness. The most consistent associations were seen with the mental health of eight year-
olds, with all four indicators of social capital being significantly associated with mental health after other variables have been controlled for. Lastly, there was some evidence to suggest that active membership of formal organisations in Vietnam may be damaging to the health of eight-year-olds but not one-year-olds, with active participation in formal groups being significantly associated with an increase in stunting among eight-year-olds. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ The aim of this paper is to assess the importance of psychosocial status in the accumulation of cognitive skills during
the transition from mid to late childhood. We use longitudinal data from a cohort of 700 Peruvian children drawn from
a very rich dataset, the Young Lives survey, to test the impact of children’s perception of respect at the age of 8 on
cognitive achievement four years later, controlling for cognitive skills at the age of 8, lagged child and household
characteristics, and community fixed effects. This empirical specification is akin to estimating a conditional demand
function for cognitive skills, which deals with some of the main pitfalls of skill endogeneity. We find that poorly
respected children are linked to a lower rate of cognitive accumulation than their better-respected counterparts. A
child’s perception of respect increases later cognitive achievement by about 7 per cent of a standard deviation, a
substantial effect given the marginal contribution of other cognitive determinants. As expected, we also find that
previously accumulated cognitive skills enable higher subsequent cognitive skill accumulation. We go one step
further by testing and finding evidence of complementarities across skills. We show that cognitive differences amplify
over time between children with low and high psychosocial skills. Overall, our results suggest that psychosocial
status, an aspect little studied in the context of developing countries, plays an important role in the acquisition of
cognitive skills during childhood. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Stunting is associated with adverse cognitive development in childhood and adolescence, fewer years of schooling, decreased productivity, and reduced adult stature. Recovery from early stunting is possible; however, few studies explore whether those who demonstrate linear catch-up growth experience long-term cognitive deficits. Using longitudinal data on 1674 Peruvian children from the Young Lives study, we identified factors associated with catch-up growth and assessed whether children who displayed catch-up growth have significantly lower cognition than children who were not stunted during infancy and childhood. Based on anthropometric data for children 6–18 mo of age and again for the same children when they were 4.5–6 y of age, we categorized participants as not stunted, stunted in infancy but not childhood (catch-up), stunted in childhood, and stunted in infancy and childhood. Children who had grandparents in the home, had less severe stunting in infancy, and had taller mothers were more likely to demonstrate catch-up growth by round 2. Children who experienced catch-up growth had verbal vocabulary and quantitative test scores that did not differ from children who were not stunted (P = 0.6 and P = 0.7, respectively). Those stunted in childhood as well as those stunted in infancy and childhood scored significantly lower on both assessments than children who were not stunted. Based on findings from this study, policy makers and program planners should consider redoubling efforts to prevent stunting and promote catch-up growth over the first few years of life as a way of improving children’s physical and intellectual development.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Longitudinal studies, such as the Young Lives study of childhood poverty, help us to analyse
welfare dynamics in ways that are not possible using time-series or cross-sectional samples.
However, analysis based on panel datasets can be heavily compromised by sample attrition.
On the one hand, the number of respondents who do not participate in each round of data
collection (wave non-response) will inevitably cumulate over time, resulting in falling sample
sizes, which will undermine the precision of any research undertaken using such samples.
On the other hand, unless it is random, attrition might lead to biased inferences. Analysts
often presuppose that attrition is correlated with observable characteristics such as
household education, health or economic well-being, resulting in samples that include only a
selected group of households. However, even if that is the case, non-random attrition does
not necessarily lead to attrition bias. Attrition bias is model-specific and, as previous studies
have shown, biases might be absent even if attrition rates are high.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We investigate the incidence and potential bias arising from attrition in Young Lives following
the completion of the second round of data collection. Young Lives is a study concerned with
analysing childhood poverty in four countries, Ethiopia, India, Vietnam and Peru. The study,
which measures a range of child, household, and household-member characteristics , is
following two cohorts of children in each country over 15 years – a younger cohort of 2,000
children who were born in 2001 to 2002 (i.e. aged 6 to 18 months when first surveyed) and
1,000 older children born in 1994-95 (i.e. aged 7.5 to 8.5 at the start of the survey).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This paper seeks to:&lt;br/&gt;
• document the rates of attrition of the Young Lives study following completion of the
second round of data collection;&lt;br/&gt;
• investigate the extent to which sample attrition is non-random;&lt;br/&gt;
• analyse whether non-random attrition in the Young Lives sample might lead to attrition bias. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Social capital has been defined in numerous ways and can refer to sociability, social networks and social support, trust, reciprocity and community and civic engagement. The effect of social capital upon children's well-being is under-researched. A theoretical model identifies potential linkages between social capital, intermediate variables and child well-being. After presenting some of the key issues in the measurement of social capital (the separation of cognitive and structural social capital, the exclusion of outcomes of social capital, the definitions of
community) this paper then considers the limited literature on conceptualizing social capital in relation to children. Quantitative measures of children's social capital need to build upon the
qualitative work available. An ongoing longitudinal study covering 8000 children in four developing countries (Vietnam, Peru, Ethiopia, and India) is introduced as one way forward. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Social capital has been shown to be positively associated with a range of health outcomes, yet no studies have explored the association between maternal social capital and child nutritional status. Using data from the Young Lives study comprising 7242 1-year-old children from Peru, Ethiopia, Vietnam and the state of Andhra Pradesh in India, we find significant differences in the levels of, in particular, structural social capital (group membership and citizenship) between countries. While few associations were found between structural measures of social capital, support from individuals and cognitive social capital (e.g. trust, social harmony) displayed fairly consistent positive associations with child nutritional status across countries.

   <dc:description> Research on policy processes has emerged over the last 30-40 years in Northern contexts. Such research has expanded into Southern contexts. An interest in the use of 'evidence' (such as research) in policy processes is a relatively recent phenomenon. There are, to date, relatively few empirical case studies in developing countries. This article seeks to address this gap by providing a comparative case study of two contexts at the opposite ends of the macro-political spectrum: Andhra Pradesh, India - a free participatory democracy with vibrant civil society - and Viet Nam - a society with, historically, more limited political freedom but with some recently introduced participatory processes and a fledgling civil society. We also consider the 'international' policy-making context. Senior policy makers and researchers working in child health policy formation were asked about their perceptions of the use of and quality of 'evidence' in health policy processes. It has been argued that greater levels of democratic freedoms are associated with greater use of evidence in policy processes. Our research challenges this and explores perceptions of the nature of 'evidence' and its use in policy processes. </dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This paper combines quantitative and qualitative analysis to develop a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of children’s work, in particular, the role of the household in determining work roles. Using a cohort study of children from Ethiopia, we examine the intra-household distribution of labour and make comparisons between households. Combining findings from these different perspectives reveals that work is fundamental to children’s lives and the functioning of their households, and is a source of pride, except when arduous or when not conforming to gender norms, which are quite pronounced – girls tend to work more in the household and boys in farming activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Adults and children were asked to estimate the hours worked by children, and the answers were extremely similar, suggesting that adults do value the contribution of their children to the household. The nature and amount of work done by children is affected less by levels of household poverty than by shocks and adverse events, such as illness and death in the family – with girls being more affected by illness and the absence of mothers. Boys work more when households have more livestock. Overall, older girls work more than their siblings, and girls work more when there are younger brothers in the house. We argue that more attention should be paid by researchers and policymakers to the interdependence between children and adults within households; the way household and sibling composition, and birth order, shape work roles; and how these factors may interact with policy changes.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Migration affects not only those who migrate, but may also have intergenerational effects on their children. Looking at those mothers with a history of internal migration who are part of the
Young Lives project, and comparing them with suitable controls, we find that mothers’ migration has had a positive impact on the nutritional outcomes and cognitive achievement of their offspring. However, we also find that there are heterogeneous impacts, as different types of migration trajectory (rural to rural; rural to urban – to intermediate cities or to the capital, Lima) can be associated with the prevalence of different channels affecting child wellbeing. Those channels are: the income channel, as migration may lead to new income-generating opportunities; the information channel, as migration may allow the mother to
access more information about child-care and health-related practices; and the access to services channel, as migration may facilitate or hinder access to key public services. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description> Accompanying the call for increased evidence-based policy the developed world is implementing more longitudinal panel studies which periodically gather information about the same people over a number of years. Panel studies distinguish between transitory and persistent states (e.g. poverty, unemployment) and facilitate causal explanations of relationships between variables. However, they are complex and costly. A growing number of developing countries are now implementing or considering starting panel studies. The objectives of this paper are to identify challenges that arise in panel studies, and to give examples of how these have been addressed in resource-constrained environments. The main issues considered are: the development of a conceptual framework which links macro and micro contexts; sampling the cohort in a cost-effective way; tracking individuals; ethics and data management and analysis. Panel studies require long term funding, a stable institution and an acceptance that there will be limited value for money in terms of results from early stages, with greater benefits accumulating in the study's mature years. </dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Using unique data from four developing countries, this paper explores the relationship between material poverty and the psychosocial competencies of children. Within a cohort of 12-year-olds, we find that measures of self-efficacy, sense of inclusion, self-esteem and educational aspirations all correlate with measures of the material well-being of the family in which they are growing up. In short, material circumstances shape these wider dimensions of child well-being. As other evidence has shown, these measures of psychosocial competencies reflect important life skills that affect children as adults and shape their future socio-economic status. This suggests a mechanism by which poverty may be transmitted across generations. In addition, our evidence shows how a caregiver's education and school participation affects children's psychosocial competencies. This may indicate a possible means of overcoming such transmission of poverty over time.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Caste-based discrimination has been a feature of Indian society for many centuries, and
despite sustained efforts by the Indian government, caste-based inequity still persists in
socio-economic status, educational attainment and in health outcomes. A potential
source of caste inequity, which is as yet unexplored, is in the differential development
of cognitive skills during early childhood. These skills have been associated with
performance in school and even with longer term employment and wage outcomes.
Current research highlights the fact that cognitive skills are malleable and can be
influenced by external environmental factors such as parental education, household
socio-economic status and child's health, especially during the initial years of a child's
life. This paper examines the link between caste and these external environmental
factors in order to highlight the channels through which caste might affect the cognitive
development of young children. We use recent longitudinal data for a cohort of
approximately 2000 young children from the Young Lives survey in the state of Andhra
Pradesh in southern India. We find significant evidence of a differential in cognitive
skill development by caste, and also that caste acts largely through lower parental
education and lower household socio-economic status, suggesting an intergenerational
mechanism of transmission of outcomes. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This paper draws on Keck and Sikkink's (1998) policy impact framework to analyse the
role of evidence and ideas in the policy process through the lens of an international policy
research project on childhood poverty, Young Lives. The paper begins by providing a brief overview of Keck and Sikkink's (1998) policy
impact framework. This framework takes into account different stages in the policy cycle,
from framing debates and agenda setting, to securing discursive and procedural changes
from key policy actors, through to affecting policy and changing behaviour among target
actors. The second section applies this fivefold framework to evaluate Young Lives'
efforts to mainstream children in poverty policy debates. Given that the four participating
Young Lives countries (Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh), Peru and Vietnam) are
geographically, politically, socio-culturally and developmentally diverse, we seek to tease
out broader lessons for advocacy around children's rights. The conclusion in Section 3 reflects on the particular challenges and insights that child-focused advocacy work raises
for international debates on evidence-based policy-making. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ The purpose of this report is to present a general context for the Young Lives qualitative
research being undertaken in Andhra Pradesh on the key themes of child well-being,
childhood transitions and children’s experiences of services and programmes. Children’s
well-being is understood in multi-dimensional terms and includes aspects relating to health,
economic conditions, educational opportunities, and relationships with family members,
peers and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The report provides an overview of existing literature on a selection of topics relating to
services for the welfare of children in India and in Andhra Pradesh in particular. It also
explores some of the issues affecting children, including access to and quality of education;
transitions, such as beginning school and the onset of puberty; the factors driving child
labour as well as the impact it has and attempts to regulate it; nutrition; discrimination and
social exclusion, especially in relation to gender and scheduled caste or tribe membership;
and migration. Policies implemented to address these issues are also examined. Rather than
a detailed policy analysis, this report provides a broad overview of some of the issues which
are key to improving our understanding of child poverty in this context and for guiding
possible research questions. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ The aim of this paper is to examine the link between early stunting and later cognitive achievement. It differs from nutrition–learning studies in other developing countries in that it focuses on pre-school children, and therefore time spent in school plays no role. Data comes from a cohort of children in Peru (Young Lives survey), for which information is available from two points of time: 2002, when they were six to 20 months old; and 2006-7, when they were 4 to 6 years old. For the empirical estimation, I use Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), controlling for lagged child and household characteristics and taking into account community characteristics. To try to identify early nutrition, I use maternal height and exposure to low temperatures during the first months of life as instrumental variables (IVs) for early nutrition. OLS results show a positive and statistically significant impact of early nutrition on cognitive achievement four years later for the full sample. Using maternal height as an instrument, IV estimations produce a higher coefficient for the parameter of interest, implying that OLS might be downward biased. Using average minimum temperature as an IV for a sub-sample of communities located in the Highlands produces results in the same direction. Preliminary results are reported and discussed.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Social protection policies in developing countries are an increasingly widespread method for tackling
chronic poverty and vulnerability and helping families manage risk. Particular schemes often provide cash,
paid work or food to poor people. Labour market protections and the linkages between cash transfers and
other public services are also important. Young Lives research has examined the impacts of specific social
protection schemes on children in Andhra Pradesh, Ethiopia and Peru. Findings suggest that social protection
brings benefits for many children and is an important part of anti-poverty strategies. However there can be
unintended consequences which policymakers need to consider. These include children having to do more
work, which can clash with their education. These findings are an important contribution to the design of
future child-centred social protection policies. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;In each study country, Young Lives is following 2000 children who were born in 2001-2 and 1000 children who were born in 1994-5. The younger children are being tracked from infancy to
their mid-teens and the older children to adulthood,
when some will become parents themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Round 2 Survey Report presents initial findings from the second round of data collection which was carried out in Ethiopia in late 2006 to early 2007. It gives a broad outline of some of the key indicators of childhood poverty and changes that have taken place in the children's lives between the first round of data collection in 2002 and this second round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summary comments on the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levels of absolute and relative poverty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to services and infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nutrition&lt;/li&gt;	
&lt;li&gt;Education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Child work&lt;/li&gt;

   <dc:description> The 'Self-reporting Questionnaire 20 items' (SRQ 20) is a widely used method of measuring mental health. The validity of SRQ 20 for determining maternal mental health was tested in Vietnam by the Young Lives programme, through a study of 66 rural women, half of whom had been identified as having poor mental health. The study validated the first reliable, cheap and easy-to-use, community-based measure of mental health for Vietnam. </dc:description>

Children's Contributions to Household Livelihoods in Ethiopia]]></dc:title>
   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This article analyses how children in Ethiopia respond to household adversity in the context of poverty. It highlights the association between poverty and other forms of hardship and the complex interplay of risk and protective factors in young people's lives. It argues that identifying adversity is not straightforward because beliefs affect the outcomes of such experiences, and different cultures and actors hold different views on the matter, so that assumed risks can in some cases be protective and foster specific competencies in the young. To support this argument, children's work - often viewed as a risk - and their role in preventing and mitigating household hardship are underlined as a potential source of protection, resilience and skills development. In this way, the limitations of research that focuses solely on detrimental child outcomes of risk exposure are revealed and the need for a more nuanced, multi-actor view of these processes is emphasised.

However, education performance indicators show that only access-related targets have been achieved, while educational quality declined in most respects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing on a sample of 1,000 children aged 7.5 to 8.5 years old from twenty sentinel sites, the Young Lives project sought to understand the determinants of school completion and achievement at the household, community, regional and national levels across different regions of Ethiopia. The paper identifies the specific factors associated with primary school completion/dropout rates, and educational achievement and performance of children, and assesses the mechanisms through which these factors are influential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A separate 6-page Executive Summary is attached. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description> An abolitionist approach to children's work bans all work; a regulatory approach bans harmful work and regulates other work. I argue for a regulatory approach, using the ‘least restrictive’ alternative test applied in law. I contend, however, that definitions of harmful work must be appropriate to local contexts and informed by working children's views. I support this with a case study of a village in Ethiopia where the current abolitionist approach is overly restrictive. However, a regulatory approach based on international definitions of harmful work would probably not protect children in the case study village against some harmful work. Children and parents in the village are able to define harmful work more precisely than international definitions, suggesting that locally specific definitions developed with working children should form the basis of regulatory legislation. </dc:description>

   <dc:description> This paper presents a case study to illustrate the range of decisions involved in designing a sampling strategy for a complex, longitudinal research study. It is based on experience from the Young Lives project and identifies the approaches used to sample children for longitudinal follow-up in four less developed countries (LDCs). The rationale for decisions made and the resulting benefits, and limitations, of the approaches adopted are discussed. Of particular importance is the choice of sampling approach to yield useful analysis; specific examples are presented of how this informed the design of the Young Lives sampling strategy. </dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Debates about social capital — particularly encouraging and harnessing women's social networks — have particular relevance in the Indian and Andhra Pradesh contexts given major donor-funded initiatives to establish women's self-help groups (SHGs). These programmes have inter alia been used to channel microfinance, improve women's income-generating opportunities, facilitate family planning coverage, and monitor social service provision. The objectives of this paper are therefore to:
a) provide a critical discussion of the concept of social capital within the context of the sociopolitical dynamics of Indian society;
b) use baseline data from the Young Lives Study conducted in Andhra Pradesh in South India to describe patterns of maternal social capital; c) explore the association between facets of maternal social capital and chronic malnutrition in children aged 6-17.9 months (referred to in brief as 'one-year-olds') - a major public health concern in the state; and d) reflect on the policy implications of our findings. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Peru is in the process of negotiating a free trade agreement (FTA) with the USA which would eliminate trade
concessions on most goods and services. This paper analyses the potential impacts of such extensive trade
liberalisation for Peru. The focus is on possible short-term welfare impacts and especially on child related
welfare outcomes. The effects of a full and abrupt elimination of tariffs as part of a FTA are estimated in a
general equilibrium framework - a branch of theoretical microeconomics which seeks to explain production,
consumption and prices in a whole economy. Using this framework the connection between domestic
prices and household welfare are modelled. Additionally, the demographic profiles of the most vulnerable
population groups are analysed to assess whether children will be at an increased risk. The modelling exercise
identifies potential negative short-term impacts of a FTA particularly for households in rural areas. Based
on these findings the authors suggest a gradual reduction of tariffs to allow time for policies to be developed
to boost rural productivity and the ability to withstand external competition. The authors conclude that a
FTA could have different negative short-term effects on children's welfare, such as increased child labour and
school drop-out rates. Therefore they recommend the creation and strengthening of social safety nets and
welfare programmes as a measurement to protect children from negative effects of a FTA with the USA. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Monitoring, protecting and promoting 'well-being' are central to realisation of children's rights. Yet definitions of the concept are both variable and can appear conceptually confused. Competing research paradigms engage with the concept and its measurement, while applications of well-being in policy are equally contested. This paper outlines some of the major debates, as a starting point for reviewing three contrasting approaches to well-being: indicator-based, participatory, and longitudinal research. In particular, it focuses on applications of the concept in contexts of child poverty worldwide. We suggest there are some promising signs of integration amongst these approaches, and argue that well-being does have potential as a bridging concept, at the same time highlighting inequalities, acknowledging diversity, and respecting children's agency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing on the experience of Young Lives, a 15 year, four-country longitudinal study of child poverty, we suggest that methods for studying child well-being in global contexts should be dynamic and sensitive to culture and time, as well as to the trade-offs that children are required to make between themselves and others. We argue that dynamic approaches are especially important in research with children as they address how people change in time. Well-being is understood by Young Lives to be about real people and the social contexts they inhabit. It can act as a lens - similar to culture - which recognises that outcomes of deprivation are influenced by children and their responses to and interpretation of events. Accessing children's views in the context of their communities is important and can increase the accuracy and credibility of research data. Crucially, well-being research also foregrounds subjective meanings and experiences, and provides the background for interpreting 'best interests'. While shared visions for well-being can set parameters of acceptability and underpin basic entitlements, detailed specification must be negotiable, especially taking account of the views of the principal stakeholders, namely children, their caregivers and others centrally concerned with their lives. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ The importance of reducing childhood undernutrition has been enshrined in the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals. This study explores the relationship between alternative indicators of poverty and childhood undernutrition in developing countries within the context of a multi-national cohort study (Young Lives). Approximately 2000 children in each of four countries – Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh), Peru and Vietnam – had their heights measured and were weighed when they were aged between 6 and 17 months (survey one) and again between 4.5 and 5.5 years (survey two). The anthropometric outcomes of stunted, underweight and wasted were calculated using World Health Organization 2006 reference standards. Maximum-likelihood probit estimation was employed to model the relationship within each country and survey between alternative measures of living standards (principally a wealth index developed using principal components analysis) and each anthropometric outcome. An extensive set of covariates was incorporated into the models to remove as much individual heterogeneity as possible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fully adjusted models revealed a negative and statistically significant coefficient on wealth for all outcomes in all countries, with the exception of the outcome of wasted in India (Andhra Pradesh) and Vietnam (survey one) and the outcome of underweight in Vietnam (surveys one and two). In survey one, the partial effects of wealth on the probabilities of stunting, being underweight and wasting was to reduce them by between 1.4 and 5.1 percentage points, 1.0 and 6.4 percentage points, and 0.3 and 4.5 percentage points, respectively, with each unit (10%) increase in wealth. The partial effects of wealth on the probabilities of anthropometric outcomes were larger in the survey two models. In both surveys, children residing in the lowest wealth quintile households had significantly increased probabilities of being stunted in all four study countries and of being underweight in Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh) and Peru in comparison to children residing in the highest wealth quintile households. Random effects probit models confirmed the statistical significance of increased wealth in reducing the probability of being stunted and underweight across all four study countries. We conclude that, although multi-faceted, childhood undernutrition in developing countries is strongly rooted in poverty.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ There are increasing calls for more child specific measures of poverty in developing countries and the need for such measures to be multi-dimensional (that is not just based on income) has been recognised. Participatory Poverty Assessments (PPAs) are now common in international development research. Most PPAs have been undertaken with adults and there are still relatively few PPAs with children. The objective of the current study was to understand adults' and children's perceptions of the causes and consequences of child poverty in rural Vietnam using a variety of participatory methods. Poor children are perceived by poor children as those who lack basic needs such as food, clothes, and safe shelter. Poor children feel they do not receive enough attention from their parents, have to work and have no safe place to play.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ High-quality early childhood care and education (ECCE) is now recognised as a core strategy for poverty
reduction. There is evidence of high returns from ECCE investments, which can contribute to global policy
priorities such as tackling child malnutrition, increasing children’s successful participation in school, and
strengthening economic development. In short, by supporting children and families early in life well-delivered
ECCE can help to interrupt the cycle of poverty. But the reality is that this potential only becomes meaningful if
ECCE programmes effectively reach the poorest and most marginalised children in the first place. Young Lives
research finds significant inequalities in access to early education in Ethiopia, India and Peru, as well as clear
discrepancies in the quality of services available. These findings underline the importance of ensuring that
high-quality care and education in early childhood reach the poorest children if these policies are to fulfil their
potential. This requires an increased focus on the most marginalised groups in society, targeted investments
to improve the quality of services, and effective governance of both public and private sector provision, to
support every child to have a good start in life. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This paper emphasises that malnutrition cannot be tackled without understanding its causes. Child malnutrition remains a major public health problem in Ethiopia, yet the government has no specific nutrition policy. Levels of wasting (acute malnutrition) and stunting (chronic malnutrition) in children aged six to fifty-nine months are among the world's highest. As long as so many children remain malnourished, Ethiopia will not achieve the first Millennium Development Goal - eradication of extreme poverty and hunger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing on a sample of 1,999 one-year-olds from twenty sentinel sites, the Young Lives Project has sought to better understand the child-, household-, community- and policy-level determinants of malnutrition and the ways in which they differ across different regions of Ethiopia. The paper quantifies the impact of poverty, healthcare and caring
practices and challenges the World Bank belief that investment in growth monitoring to promote change in caregivers'
behaviour will, by itself, significantly improve nutritional status.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coverage of health services may have expanded, but limited and costly services discourage users. Health care choices primarily depend not on proximity to health facilities but lack of quality services. Respondents complained about inadequate equipment, poorly trained and/or insensitive medical staff and expensive medication. A number of measures for tackling child malnutrition are recommended.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A separate 9-page Executive Summary is attached. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;This report presents initial findings from the second round of data collection in Peru
between late 2006 and early 2007. It provides a broad outline of key child poverty indicators, as well as changes that have taken place since the first round of research
in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the economic and policy context in Peru has become more favourable - following recent economic growth and increased awareness of the importance of early childhood -inequalities between different groups persist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings show that rural and ethnic minority children are more likely to experience
poorer nutrition and educational outcomes, and have lower levels of access to electricity, safe water and sanitation facilities. The data also show how such inequalities interrelate, for example, poor access to services appears to influence nutritional patterns of stunting and being underweight. Interestingly, urban children report higher levels of subjective wellbeing than their rural counterparts, and ethnic minority children lower levels, perhaps due to perceptions of discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence of gender inequalities is also found with faltering growth and lower levels of pre-school enrolment among girls, especially in rural areas. Primary school enrolment is more equal but boys are already at an advantage in learning and making the transition to school, following their time at pre-school. Similarly, differences in nutritional status between urban and rural children seem to be defined in the early stages of life. All these findings underline the importance of investing in early childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future Young Lives research will continue to investigate the inequalities in Peru with particular reference to socio-economic status, the urban-rural divide, gender and ethnicity. It is hoped that empirical evidence of this kind will play a greater role in shaping child-related
policies in future.&lt;/p&gt; ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Women and the poor are disproportionately affected by common mental disorders (CMD), and women in low income countries are particularly at risk. Social capital may explain some of the geographical variation in CMD, but the association between social capital and CMD in low income countries has rarely been studied. This paper aims to explore the relationship between individual and ecological measures of social capital and maternal CMD in four low income countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Cross-sectional data from the Young Lives (YL) study with information across 234 communities in Peru, Ethiopia, Vietnam and Andhra Pradesh (India) were used. The mental health of mothers of one-year-old children (n=6909), and the individual cognitive and structural social capital of all respondents was assessed. Ecological social capital was calculated by aggregating individual responses to the community level. Multi-level modelling was used to explore the association between individual and ecological (community level) social capital and maternal CMD in each of the four countries, adjusting for a wide range of individual and community level confounders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The analysis shows that individual cognitive social capital is associated with reduced odds of CMD across all four countries. The results for structural social capital are more mixed and culturally specific, with some aspects associated with increased odds of CMD. This suggests that structural social capital has context-specific effects and cognitive social capital more universal effects on maternal CMD.

   <dc:title>Adult education and child nutrition: the role of family and community</dc:title>
   <dc:subject rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Longitudinal_Studies"/>
   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Background: It is well established that mothers’ education has positive effects on child nutrition in developing countries. Less explored is the effect exerted by the education of other individuals—mothers’ friends, neighbours and family. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Objectives: To examine independent effects of mothers’, fathers’ and grandmothers’ education on child height-for-age and weight-for-age z-score, and the role of community-level maternal literacy over and above parental education and other individual-level factors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Methods: Cross-sectional data were analysed for 5692 children from Andhra Pradesh State in India and Vietnam sampled within “sites” (20 from each country) and then within “communities” (31 from Vietnam and 102 from India). Multilevel regression analysis was undertaken to account for confounders and geographical clustering of observations. 
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results: Child nutrition is positively and independently associated with mothers’, fathers’ and grandmothers’ education. The association with grandmothers’ education was statistically significant in the India sample only and was stronger for boys: the adjusted mean difference in height-for-age z-scores between boys living with an educated grandmother and those not was 0.64 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.99, p&lt;0.001). In the Vietnam sample, child nutrition was associated with the proportion of literate mothers in the community, adjusting for parental education and other confounders (height 0.81, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.31, p&amp;#8202;=&amp;#8202;0.002). 
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conclusion: The results imply that an individual-level perspective may fail to capture the entire impact of education on child nutrition, and support a call for a widening of focus of nutrition policy and programmes from the mother–child pair towards the broader context of their family and community.

   <dc:description> Ethiopia has one of the worst health outcomes in the world. In recent years, a new health policy resulted in some improvements in the population’s health and a new health financing strategy led to critical changes in the financing structure of healthcare. However, user fees for healthcare remain an important element of healthcare financing. This study explored perceptions, attitudes and experiences with user fees at public health facilities among poor male and female household members. The objectives were to investigate (1) how poor households’ members experience user fees at public health facilities and (2) how user fees influence health-seeking behaviours of poor household members. The study used quantitative data from Round 2 of the Young Lives study and qualitative data from a substudy in four sites. We found that user fees can present a substantial psychological and financial burden and are one of the barriers to healthcare use, especially for poor households. For some families the costs of a sudden health shock combined with loss of income and assets can lead to indebtedness, distress asset sales and hardening of poverty cycles. Our findings suggest that pre-payment and risk-sharing mechanisms such as the traditional Eders or health tax might be an accepted and sustainable alternative to user fees and protect against impoverishment in case of major health events. To make cost-sharing for healthcare more equitable, it also needs to be based on income to be truly in accordance with ‘ability to pay’. </dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ The authors review the contribution of qualitative methods to exploring concepts and experiences of wellbeing among children and adults living in developing countries. They provide examples illustrating the potential of these methods for gaining a holistic and contextual understanding of people's perceptions and experiences. Some of these come from Young Lives, an innovative long-term international research project investigating the changing nature of child poverty in India, Ethiopia, Peru and Vietnam, and others from the Wellbeing in Developing Countries ESRC research group (WeD), an international, inter-disciplinary project exploring the social and cultural construction of wellbeing in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Peru and Thailand (http://www.welldev.org.uk). The authors show how qualitative methods can be used both alongside and as part of the development of sensitive and relevant quantitative measures, and provide some practical and methodological recommendations. They propose that qualitative approaches are essential in understanding people's experiences of wellbeing, both now and in the future. However, the authors caution that while these offer many benefits, for example, a less structured and hierarchical engagement between researcher and participant; they require time, energy, and sensitivity. Qualitative methods also work best when used by trained and experienced researchers working in the local language/s in a community where some rapport has already been established. Finally, the paper recommends combining data from qualitative and quantitative approaches (e.g. psychological measures or household surveys) to enhance its explanatory power.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;This research was carried out in the state of Andhra Pradesh (AP), India. Like other Indian
states, AP has agreed to devolve functions and responsibilities to local bodies. However,
analysis of this process suggests that the decentralisation has been only partial, with most
policies still being set by the state rather than by local governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of this paper is to assess whether the government of AP is giving sufficient priority to investment in children at the state and the sub-state levels, through both rural and
urban local bodies, to ensure improved outcomes for children. The research therefore sets
out to examine the mechanisms in place within this decentralised structure to enable greater
and better-quality spending on children, with a particular focus on rural bodies or panchayat
raj institutions (PRIs). PRIs make up the three-tiered elected structure of rural governance
which, as a result of the 73rd Constitutional Amendment in 1994, is meant to provide new
avenues of political participation by including representatives from different sections of
society (backward castes, Scheduled Castes  SCs , Scheduled Tribes  STs  and women) in
decision-making bodies at the local level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The initial premise of the present study was that the decentralised planning process in PRIs,
particularly with the inclusion of women as elected representatives, might encourage greater
prioritisation of children's needs in planning and budgeting decisions at the local level.
However, the research found that this was seldom the case. Even though the
focus was more on rural local bodies, findings were also drawn from two urban bodies, in order to build a more comprehensive picture of the visibility of children in budgets and spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In trying to understand how budget outlays can lead to positive outcomes for child wellbeing,
it is essential to understand the mediating factors that constrain or facilitate service
delivery. Therefore, in assessing resource flows to local bodies, the
role and commitment of various government officers and elected representatives within
the PRI structure in relation to decisions about spending on child-focused services and
improving the implementation of schemes was briefly examined. This will help in assessing the potential for improving
spending on children at the local level in response to locally identified needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper is structured as follows: Following the introduction, Section 2 examines the theoretical background
underpinning the field research. Firstly, the rationale for undertaking local level
budget analysis is considered; secondly, some of the realities of decentralisation
in AP are examined; and thirdly, the possible spaces available at the local level to ensure that
children's needs receive adequate attention in budgets are investigated. Section 3 describes the research
methodology used, while Section 4 explores key findings in the light of the theoretical
background. The last section draws out the conclusions and some policy recommendations
that could help to raise the priority level accorded to investment in children at the substate
level in AP with the aim of achieving better outcomes for children, particularly for
the poorest.&lt;/p&gt;

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Objective:  To assess the occurrence of child injury in four developing country settings and to explore potential risk factors for injury.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Methods:  Injury occurrence was studied in cohorts of 2000 children of age 6–17 months at enrolment, in each of Ethiopia, Peru, Vietnam and India (Andhra Pradesh). Generalized estimating equation models were used to explore potential risk factors for child injury.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Results:  Occurrence of child injury was high in all countries. Caregiver depression emerged as a consistent risk factor for all types of injury measured (burns, serious falls, broken bones and near-fatal injury) across all countries. Other risk factors also showed consistent associations, including long-term child health problems, region of residence and the regular care of the child by a non-household member.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Conclusions:  This report provides further evidence of the importance of childhood injury in developing countries and emphasizes the importance of including infants in injury research and prevention strategies. It provides strong evidence of an association between caregiver mental health and child injury risk and contributes to the limited knowledge base on risk factors for child injury in developing countries.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ A great deal of attention is now paid to the ethics of social research. Research governance has expanded, and a burgeoning literature is emerging that describes the processes, practices and questions that arise in social research with children, families and communities. This paper outlines the approach taken to research ethics within Young Lives, a long-term study of childhood poverty in four developing countries. It describes some of the practical difficulties that Young Lives faces, and emphasises the importance of understanding local contexts in undertaking research with children and families in environments that are dynamic and may change rapidly from one year to the next, economically, environmentally and politically. The paper aims to contribute to current debates about research practices, the ethics of longitudinal research with children and research with communities in majority world contexts, in the spirit of shared enquiry and learning.

   <dc:description> The editorial describes how the papers in the special issue on 'Children and young people in a changing world' engage with the views and experiences of children, as well as adults, to analyse the impact of social protection and social mobility through education and employment on their well-being. It takes a slightly critical approach to concepts such as well-being and agency—acknowledging that these frequently embrace their opposites—and highlights the value of mixed methods in exploring themes such as ‘voice and visibility’, schooling and work, and child poverty and outcomes. Finally, it draws out common conclusions and discusses their implications for policy and programme design. </dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ The importance of community participation in development policy decisions has gained increasing international recognition in the last decade. Most notably, participation is now included as a core assessment criterion in the World Bank and IMF-led Poverty Reduction Strategy process to which all low-income countries are party. During the same period, the value of children's participation in decisions that impact on their lives and that of their communities has also gained more attention. The UN General Assembly's Special Session on Children in 2002 (including the national and regional processes leading up to the final meeting) highlighted children's right to voice their views and be heard as enshrined in article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC).&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
However, while a growing body of analysis has emerged assessing children's involvement in, for example, school governance, child workers' movements, and children's clubs and networks, to date there have been relatively few systematic assessments of the impact of children's participation on policy change. There is still a dearth of knowledge about the factors that facilitate or hinder the translation of children's voices into not only improved discursive practices, but more child-sensitive policy and decision-making and programme implementation, in different political and economic contexts. In order to contribute to this important debate, this paper focuses on initiatives to promote children's participation at various points in Vietnam's national poverty reduction policy process.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
Vietnam is an interesting case for several reasons: since the initiation of economic reform (Doi Moi) in the mid-1980s, the government has been praised for its successful poverty reduction achievements and rewarded with strong donor support. Moreover, Communist Party official documents and national laws alike are committed to the fulfillment of children's rights. Although national leaders have rejected pressures to move towards a Western liberal model of party democracy, in 2005 an ambitious nationwide consultation process around the governments overarching Socio-Economic Development Plan (2006-2010) was launched from the grassroots level upwards to collate views about the government's planned policy direction. Young Lives, an international policy research project on childhood poverty in Vietnam, was involved in this process as part of the INGO coalition that implemented the consultation in tandem with the Ministry of Planning and Investment and local government authorities. This paper's central objective is to reflect on the nature and impact of children's participation in this new political space. It pays particular attention to the contribution that children's involvement can have in breaking poverty cycles (both life-course and inter-generational poverty transmissions).&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
Section 1 begins with a discussion on some theoretical literature on participation, poverty and rights, as well as international experiences of children's participation in policy processes. It pays particular attention to the challenges that have been identified in ensuring children's meaningful and sustainable participation. Section 2 uses this framework to discuss Young Lives' multi-pronged strategy to involve Vietnamese children in poverty reduction debates and processes. The final section concludes with lessons learned and recommended future steps in Vietnam. It also includes more general reflections on the potential of children's right to participation to shape broader state-civil society interactions and remould definitions and practices of citizenship. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;Micro-finance programmes have become a popular approach to promote women's
economic empowerment and have been widely adopted by government, donors and NGOs
alike in Andhra Pradesh state in India. The popularity of women's self-help groups (SHGs)
and micro-finance programmes in development policy circles reflects the common
assumption that empowering women will improve household well-being, lead to better
outcomes for children and promote social capital development and community involvement
in poverty alleviation initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper assesses the inter-generational impacts of
women's participation in micro-credit programmes and the transmission mechanisms
through which children's wellbeing is affected by different dimensions of women's
empowerment. The over-arching question is to what extent are these linkages due to
ripple effects and to what extent the result of deliberate policy intentions to tackle
childhood poverty. These questions are important as international development experience
has shown that reduction in aggregate poverty levels does not automatically translate
into diminished poverty for children.&lt;/p&gt;

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This invitation-only event (held in the Hague) for senior Dutch policymakers, practitioners and scholars working with an interest in childhood poverty and related poverty issues discussed two key areas of concern that are currently emerging in international policy debates on poverty: How can we tackle persistent poverty, and intimately linked to this question, what can be done to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Four presentations from the Young Lives team gave an overview of some of the recent Young Lives research findings, set against the context of a presentation by Franta Wijchers from the Dutch embassy in Addis Ababa about the reality of matching government and donor policy in Ethiopia. This framed a wider discussion of how research can be used by policymakers and the kind of policy changes that are needed to break the intergenerational transmission of poverty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following several years of economic growth, poverty reduction and improvements in infrastructure (witnessed in all 4 Young Lives study countries), the current global economic downturn and crisis in food and fuel prices is having a direct impact on children’s lives. Young Lives research provides evidence of how fragile the gains experienced by many poor households are, and even relatively short-term shocks (such as illness or death of a family member, drought or flooding, crop failure or livestock disease) can have long-term impacts on child well-being. For example, 20% of the children in the Young Lives sample in Ethiopia had lost either one or both parents by the age of 12, with lasting effects on their schooling, confidence, and self-esteem. The presentations focused on the challenges of increasing access to education while at the same time improving quality – and the challenge of meeting parents’ and children’s hopes and aspirations surrounding their education. Children strive hard to balance their learning with other responsibilities and roles in their families and communities – and this interface is one of the sites where the struggle between tradition and modern attitudes plays itself out. The current global economic downturn means that we need to find ways of delivering quality education that is relevant to the reality of children’s lives as well as new sustainable models of education to help children escape the poverty trap. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young Lives presentations (attached in PDF format) were:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jo Boyden: Young Lives and the Dynamics of Child Poverty &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catherine Porter: Longitudinal Research: Benefits and Challenges&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Martin Woodhead: Education For All… Including Early Education for All?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ajay Sinha: Policy Priorities and Public Finance for Children in Young Lives Countries (India)

   <dc:description> This paper uses data from a 2002 survey of 1000 rural and urban households with eight-year old children sampled from food insecure communities in Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, SNNP and Addis Ababa Regional States. Using a probit regression model, we investigated external factors associated with child enrolment in school. We found that household wealth, cognitive social capital, adult education and ownership of land had a positive impact on whether eight-year-old children were attending school. Household wealth had the strongest impact followed by cognitive social capital (perceived levels of trust and reciprocity), the maximum level of education attained by female adults in the household, ownership or rental of land, and the maximum level of education attained by male adults in the household. In contrast, child enrolment was found to be negatively associated with the number of household members over the age of 15 years, birth order, ownership of livestock, economic shocks, distance to primary school, and child labour, in declining magnitude. The findings in general suggest that increasing child enrolment in primary school, which is a commitment of the Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Program (SDPRP) and Education Sector Development Program (ESDP), will necessitate more targeted educational policies to address regional, gender and wealth disparities, the development of education programmes for adult caregivers, as well as broader inter-sectoral policy initiatives to ensure that policy initiatives in other sectors facilitate rather than hinder children’s education (particularly credit and labour markets and infrastructure-related policies). </dc:description>

   <dc:description> The two papers contained in this working paper are concerned with the validation of social capital and adult mental health measures in Vietnam. The social capital measure (the Short A-SCAT) has been tested for reliability in Colombia (outside the realm of YL research) and has been tested for validity in the Peruvian component of the YL project. The adult mental health measure (SRQ20) has been tested for validity and reliability in over 20 developing countries (including India, Ethiopia and Peru - the other three YL countries) but has not been previously used or tested in Vietnam. Future validation studies will include an assessment of the child mental health measure (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire - SDQ), which YL has used across the four countries involved in the study. </dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Debates on the consequences of globalisation mostly ignore issues related to children - particularly their wellbeing,
rights and poverty experiences. However, globalisation and trade liberalisation are likely to have a major impact on the lives of poor children and their families. Given that children comprise a significant proportion of the population in developing countries, that impacts on children's welfare and poverty status tend to have a long-term effect on their development over their life-course and potentially generate intergenerational transfers of poverty, any discussion of the social impacts of trade must be approached from a child-sensitive perspective.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The international community emphasises trade liberalisation as a tool for poverty reduction. Yet trade liberalisation does not uniformly affect all segments of a population and its effects on poverty reduction are not always experienced in the short term. Developing country governments must pay attention to these differential impacts in order to mitigate the inequities that trade liberalisation is likely to exacerbate in developing countries. Policy impacts on children need to be traced from the changes they generate on macroeconomic variables (from consumer prices to individual household livelihoods) and the complexity of differential intra-household effects. Such analysis is important if policies are to compensate for any negative impacts and to harness the benefits of liberalisation to improve the conditions of children living in poverty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This briefing paper begins by examining the general ways in which trade liberalisation can affect children. It then discusses findings from Young Lives (YL) quantitative and qualitative research in Peru and Ethiopia in order to demonstrate these impacts before discussing policy implications. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:title>How Can Children Tell Us About Their Wellbeing? Exploring the Potential of Participatory Research Approaches within Young Lives.</dc:title>
   <j.0:fundingPhase rdf:resource="http://data.younglives.org.uk/data/younglivesStudyStructure/FundingPhaseThree"/>
   <dc:description><![CDATA[ 'Wellbeing' is a key concept in the study of children's lives over time, given its potential to link the objective, subjective, and inter-subjective dimensions of their experiences in ways that are holistic, contextualized and longitudinal. For this reason wellbeing is one of the core concepts used by Young Lives, a 15-year project (2000–2015) that follows the lives of 12,000 children growing up in the context of poverty in Ethiopia, Peru, Vietnam and Andhra Pradesh (India). This paper examines a selection of methods being used by Young Lives to capture aspects of child wellbeing in the context of a range of children's life experiences related to poverty, specific risks and protective processes. It draws on a review of the literature on child-focused methods and on recent experiences piloting three core qualitative methods in the four study countries. The paper reports the development of a methodology that is child-centred, but also acknowledges that every child is embedded within a network of social and economic relationships.

   <dc:title>Early nutrition and later cognitive achievement in developing countries</dc:title>
   <dc:description> This study uses longitudinal data from 8,000 children in four developing countries (Young Lives Survey) to explore the linkages between nutritional status and later cognitive achievement on preschool children. Using multivariate regression analysis, a positive association between early nutrition (measured by Height-for-Age WHO Z-scores) and later preschool cognitive achievement is found in all the study countries. Similar evidence is found for school age children. Results control for a wide array of child, parental and household characteristics and include cluster fixed effects to account for between-community heterogeneity. These results suggest that, compared to well-nourished children, children that became malnourished early in life are in cognitive disadvantage before school enrolment. </dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Study objective: To explore the association between maternal social capital and child physical and mental health in Vietnam. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Design: Cross sectional survey. Measures of maternal structural social capital comprised group membership, citizenship, and social support. Measures of cognitive social capital comprised trust, social harmony, sense of fairness, and belonging. Child health was measured by anthropometrics and mothers’ reports of acute and chronic physical health problems and child mental health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Participants: 2907 mothers and their 1 year old or 8 year old children from five provinces in Vietnam. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Main results: The study found low levels of group membership and citizenship and high levels of cognitive social capital and support, and generally higher levels of social capital among the mothers of 8 year old compared with 1 year old children. All but one association was in the hypothesised direction (that is, higher levels of social capital associated with reduced risk of child health problems). There were more statistically significant relations between maternal social capital and the health of 1 year olds compared with 8 year old children, and between measures of social support and cognitive social capital and child health, than with group membership and involvement in citizenship activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conclusion: This study is the first to explore the association between multiple dimensions of social capital and a range of different child health outcomes in the developing world. These results now need to be tested using longitudinal data.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This report presents initial findings from the second round of data collection carried out in
Ethiopia in late 2006 to early 2007. It does not aim to give a comprehensive overview of all
the findings from Young Lives. Rather it gives a broad outline of some of the key indicators of
childhood poverty and changes that have taken place in the children's lives between the first
round of data collection in 2002 and the second. Data are mainly presented for the entire age
group cohort, in most cases separated into wealth groups or by rural/urban location. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From our survey data, there are signs that the economic growth and improved access to
services have been broadly inclusive. We see that children's well-being – in all dimensions –
is strongly linked to, and determined by, their socio-economic status and parents'
backgrounds. Over the past 5 years, there have been obvious improvements in basic
services, and school enrolment is up, although quality of education is now a key priority for
the government. Nutrition remains a challenge, with high levels of undernutrition, although in
other ways we have seen obvious recovery following the 2002 drought.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Findings are presented on: Levels of absolute and relative poverty; Access to services and infrastructure; Nutrition; Education; Child work; and Subjective well-being (older cohort). ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ The purpose of this paper is to assess how the needs of children are incorporated into Ethiopia's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)—known as the Ethiopian Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Programme 2002-
2005 (SDRDP) —and to develop policy recommendations for the second PRSP based on a comparative content analysis with other countries' PRSPs. The paper begins by identifying the key ingredients of a child-centred PRSP, including: consideration of childhood poverty in the document's poverty analysis; spaces for consultation with children; child-specific policies and programmes as well as child-sensitive macro-development policies; institutionalized mechanisms to coordinate these policy approaches and the inclusion of child-related progress indicators. The second section uses a content analysis methodology to consider the extent to which the Ethiopian PRSP is pro-poor and pro-child and contrasts this to more child-sensitive approaches in other PRSPs. The paper then analyses the SDPRP's policies,
programmes and indicators using a rights-based framework. It assesses the extent to which both the direct (child-specific
policy commitments) and indirect (macro-development) policies are in keeping with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) principles of child survival, development, protection, equal treatment and participation. The paper concludes by drawing on the best practices of PRSPs in other countries and outlining how a child-focused PRSP could more effectively address the multi-dimensionality of childhood poverty in Ethiopia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A separate 4-page Executive Summary is attached. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This paper reviews interdisciplinary research on children's time use. Following the
introduction, Section 2 sketches the broad historical and socio-cultural context for time-use
studies, recognising that how childhood has been variously understood affects the valuation
of children's activities, roles and relationships and the ways they are experienced. It will
become clear that differing views about children's 'proper' time use have coincided with
powerful assumptions about children's roles throughout history, and the 'value' of children's
time. We offer a selective review of studies addressing time use from a range of disciplinary
perspectives, in order to highlight how the use of time is not only associated with economic
value, but also socio-cultural values. Whether or not certain children's activities are
considered permissible, acceptable and appropriate by adult members of society largely
depends upon how these activities fit into local value systems. Section 3 briefly explores
subjective dimensions of time use, drawing on contrasting paradigms for studying how far
children perceive time differently to adults. This question is addressed from a developmental
psychological and social constructionist perspective. Finally, Section 4 offers an overview of
research methods that have been utilised in studies of children's time use. This review is not
exhaustive of methods in time-use research, but is intended as a summary resource for YL
and other child researchers. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;If India is to reach the Millennium Development Goals to reduce child mortality, eradicate hunger and promote gender equality, innovative policy solutions are urgently needed as economic growth and overall poverty reduction alone will not be enough. This paper evaluates an attempt in Andhra Pradesh to improve the outreach, quality and accountability of educational, health and Early Childhood Development services by involving parents closely in their monitoring and management. Participatory Education Committees and Mothers' Committees were established in the context of a growing consensus in national and international policy circles that decentralisation and community participation are critical for improved coverage, responsiveness and quality of public services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there have been some clear gains in terms of greater participation among parents in child-related user committees, opportunities for meaningful participation are still mediated to a significant degree by committee members' class, caste, gender and political affiliations. These grassroots parallel institutions have had some impact on service delivery for poor children, particularly in terms of outreach and infrastructural development. They have been less effective, however, in shaping service quality and institutionalising linkages with decision makers who have the power to influence policy development.&lt;/p&gt; ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description> User participation has been promoted to improve the quality, responsiveness, and outreach of public services in India. This qualitative study evaluates new grassroots institutions—Village Education Committees and Mothers' Committees—in Andhra Pradesh, which promoting parents' participation in the management and monitoring of local schools and maternal/child health services. Although the committees were found to have increased participation in public affairs by the poor and brought about some improvements in service quality, inclusive and meaningful participation has often been hindered by illiteracy and lack of information, as well as caste, gender, and socioeconomic inequalities. The article suggests that there are considerable tensions between inclusive participation and committee effectiveness as members need skills, status, and resources in order to have a meaningful impact on service provision. In addition, research findings point to the need for more structured opportunities for committee members to interact with authorities and service providers, as well as for children to voice their concerns and ideas. Lastly, in order to tackle childhood poverty more holistically, the focus of these committees should be revised to give greater emphasis to improving service quality improvements and cross-sectoral synergies, rather than the current move narrow focus on infrastructural development and singlesector initiatives. </dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This paper asks whether there is a boy bias in household-level education expenditure for households with children aged 5 
to 19 years old in Andhra Pradesh in India, based on Round 2 of the Young Lives survey conducted in 2006. The sample contains 982 households comprising 2578 children. The analysis is based on both demand analysis and a hurdle model. The results show that there is a bias favouring boys in terms of school enrolment as the children get older, captured by age categories 10–14 and 15–19. There is also a bias favouring boys in household education expenditure allocation, given positive expenditure, when children are between 10 and 14 years of age, driven mainly by extra tuition fees. Quite notably, once the households have decided to educate a child beyond the upper primary level (i.e., beyond grade 8), there is no gender-based expenditure bias and an equal proportion of boys and girls are sent to private schools that provide better quality education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A separate 1-page Research Summary, which presents the main findings and policy implications of the Working Paper in easily understood language, is also attached.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Child labour in India has long been the focus of research, policy concern and intervention. This paper presents a preliminary analysis of children's work in cottonseed production in Andhra Pradesh, drawing on evidence from two case studies from the qualitative component of Young Lives. In parts of rural Andhra Pradesh, children work in the cotton fields for two to three months of the school year. Children highlighted the importance of this work in their everyday lives and its consequences for their schooling. Evidence shows marked gender and age differentiation. In the early stages of cotton production, there was reported to be a cultural as well as an economic basis for children's work in cottonseed pollination, when it was believed that pre-pubescent girls were preferred for this kind of work, as they were considered to be 'pure'. However, this has shifted somewhat, and children appear to work in cotton
pollination for economic reasons, as well as practical ideas that they are better-suited to this type of work because of their physical height and dexterity. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the research for discourses related to children’s rights in India.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A separate 1-page Research Summary, which presents the main findings and policy implications of the Working Paper in easily understood language, is also attached. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description> The purpose of this paper is to present and discuss empirical information on the educational opportunities and outcomes of indigenous speaking children as compared to their Spanish-speaking counterparts in Peru. This paper is organized as follows: after a brief introduction it presents several social and economic indicators for indigenous and Spanish-speakers in Peru. The third section presents descriptive information on diverse educational outcomes for these groups and a multivariate analysis of the determinants of achievement, decomposing the factors that predict the gap between indigenous and Spanish-speakers. The fourth section describes intercultural bilingual policies and its implementation. The final section presents some preliminary conclusions and suggestions for further research and policies. </dc:description>

   <dc:description> This paper discusses the advantages and challenges of using qualitative methods to elicit poor children's perspectives about threats and positive influences on their wellbeing. It draws on research carried out by the author on the subjective experiences of poor children in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia in terms of their understandings of wellbeing, threats to their wellbeing, coping strategies, and positive or resilient outcomes. After a brief introduction reviewing previous approaches to child poverty in general and research on Ethiopian children in particular, the second section describes the research setting and the ethical approach to the study, which influenced how consent was obtained and the data analysed. The paper then describes the use of qualitative methods such as semi-structured interviews, draw-and-tell, and diaries, the kinds of data they produced and the methodological and ethical dilemmas and tensions encountered in using them. It concludes that despite the challenges qualitative methods are invaluable in order to understand what poor children see as threats and positive influences on their wellbeing. </dc:description>

   <dc:description> The calculation of income-poverty profiles should allow for household size and composition, but rarely does so. Failure to do so means that the poverty profile will be distorted. The appropriate adjustments are straightforward, requiring simple assumptions which, whilst arbitrary, are better than ignoring the problem. Not making these adjustments not only distorts the relationship between household size and poverty, but all aspects of the poverty profile correlated to household size. We show that in the case of Vietnam if the adjustments are not made, rural poverty is under-stated as is poverty amongst those with little education, minority ethnic groups and female-headed households. Relatively far fewer children live in poverty than is suggested when the appropriate data adjustments are not made. </dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ The NREGS is an ambitious public works program intended to provide a basic safety net
to the rural poor in India. Institutionalised in 2005, it is currently the largest public works
program in the world. Despite its scale and the political importance attached to the
program, its success in targeting and its impact on participating households has not been
well studied. This paper attempts to study two aspects of the program’s functioning using
data from the Young Lives longitudinal Study conducted in Andhra Pradesh. Firstly it
looks at the targeting of the program and the characteristics of those who self select into it.
We find that poorer and lower caste households are more likely to register as are those
affected by drought. We also find that having more than 5 influential relatives increases the
probability of registration by 10.3 percentage points. We next attempt to estimate the
impact of program participation on the children in participating households, looking
specifically at anthropometric scores as indicators of health outcomes, and the incidence of
child labour. While there seems to be a positive correlation between program participation
and health outcomes, this does not remain robust across specifications. On the other hand
we find that program registration reduces the probability of a boy entering child labour by
13.4% points and program take up reduces it for girls by 8.19% points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is suggested that the targeting efficiency of the program seems to be largely effective and it
seems to offer a viable security net for households with variable employment opportunities.
It also seems to have an important effect on children, further strengthening the program’s
significance. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:title>Technical Note No. 1. An Assessment of the Young Lives Sampling Approach in Ethiopia.</dc:title>
   <dc:subject rdf:resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Young_Lives"/>
   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Young Lives is a longitudinal research project investigating the changing nature of childhood
poverty. The study is tracking the development of 12,000 children in Ethiopia, Peru, India
(Andhra Pradesh) and Vietnam through qualitative and quantitative research over a 15-year
period. Since 2002, the study is following two cohorts in each study country. The younger
cohort or 1-year-old cohort consists of 2,000 children per study country aged between 6 and
18 months in 2002. The older cohort or 8-year-old cohort consists of 1,000 children per
country aged between 7.5 and 8.5 years in 2002. The key objectives of Young Lives are: (i)
to improve the understanding of causes and consequences of childhood poverty, (ii) to inform
the development and implementation of future policies and practices that will reduce
childhood poverty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sampling methodology adopted for Ethiopia is known as sentinel site surveillance
system. It consists of a multi-stage sampling procedure, whereby households within a
sentinel site were selected randomly, while sentinel sites were chosen on basis of a number
of predetermined criteria, informed by the objectives of the study. Specifically, in the
Ethiopian context sentinel sites have been selected so as to ensure that (i) the cultural and
geographic diversity of the country is reflected in the sample, (ii) the urban and rural
differences are captured, and (iii) the pro-poor bias of the project is fulfilled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this report is to assess the sampling methodology by comparing the samples with
two larger, nationally representative samples. This analysis serves two main purposes. First,
to analyse how the Young Lives children and households compare with children in Ethiopia,
in terms of their living standards and other characteristics. Second, to examine whether and
how this may affect inferences between the data. We will establish to what extent the Young
Lives sample is a relatively poorer or richer Ethiopian sub-population, and whether different
levels of living standards are represented in the dataset. The findings can provide guidance
for interpreting research that uses Young Lives data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Our analysis will compare a number of living standard indicators from the Young Lives
sample with equivalent indicators from two different nationally representative samples: the
Demographic and Health Survey 2000 (DHS) (CSA 2001a) and the 2000 Welfare Monitoring
Survey (WMS) (CSA 2001b).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Based on the Young Lives sampling procedure we expect to find significant biases in the
Young Lives sample. The aim of Young Lives is to document child poverty. Therefore, oversampling
of poor sites mainly in food-deficient areas took place. However, budgeting
constraints and concerns regarding the long-term sustainability of the study meant that the
rural sites selected were located in relatively better accessible areas. This is likely to have
resulted in Young Lives rural households being located in wealthier sites than the typical
Ethiopian rural household.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The report is structured as follows. In Section 2, we provide a brief overview of Ethiopia.
Section 3, describes the Young Lives sampling approach. Section 4, presents the
methodology used in our analysis. In Section 5, we briefly describe the two comparison
samples. Section 6 and 7 discuss the main results from our comparison exercise. Section 8
analyses the effects of secular trends using information from the DHS 2005 sample. Finally,
Section 9 concludes. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Parental death is one of the many risks faced by children in poor communities, especially in Africa in the context
of the HIV/AIDS pandemic.While the death of a parent at any age is a significant and distressing event, Young
Lives research in Ethiopia finds that the age the child is when a parent dies is important for outcomes later on. If
a parent dies early on in a child’s life (between ages 0 and 6) then the death per se does not seem to affect
children’s health, education, sense of optimism or self-esteem at age 12, in part due to the fact that younger
children are more likely to be absorbed into the care of close relatives. In sharp contrast, if its mother dies in
middle childhood (between ages 7 and 12) a child is less likely to be enrolled at school or to be able to read or
write, and if the father dies it seems to reduce the child’s sense of optimism. These effects appear to apply
equally to boys and girls alike. These findings are an important contribution towards the development of a
policy framework for supporting orphans and other vulnerable children in Ethiopia. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:title>Young Lives Preliminary Country Report: Andhra Pradesh, India.</dc:title>
   <dc:description><![CDATA[ The Young Lives Project is a longitudinal study in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam. In each of the countries, the first phase of the project included the first survey of 2,000 index children aged around one year and a survey of 1,000 children aged around eight years, evenly spread across 20 sentinel sites per country. The Young Lives Project is unique in measuring child well-being in a holistic and consistent way across several developing countries, including economic, social, physical and demographic aspects. Data collection finished in 2003 and an important priority has been the early production of a preliminary report from each country, each report following a similar structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In India, the project has been implemented in Andhra Pradesh by two organisations, Centre for Economic and Social Studies (CESS), Hyderabad and Save the Children UK (India). During the first phase of the study, 2,000 index children aged 6-17.9 months (one-year-olds) and 1,000 children aged 7.5-8.5 years (eight-year-olds) and their households were selected from 20 sentinel sites located across the three regions of Andhra Pradesh. Survey methods included household
questionnaires completed by caregivers, child anthropometric measurements, an eight-year-old respondent questionnaire and a community questionnaire. Fieldwork was undertaken in Andhra
Pradesh between September and December 2002. This preliminary country report presents key descriptive results from the first round of data collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this preliminary report are: (1) to present a brief literature review of general poverty - both income and non-income and child poverty in India and Andhra Pradesh; (2) to review national policies which have an impact on child poverty, and identify key national audiences for this study; (3) to describe the study methods and present preliminary, descriptive results; (4) to identify provisional
conclusions and policy implications.

   <dc:title>Persistent Stunting in Middle Childhood: The Case of Andhra Pradesh Using Longitudinal Data</dc:title>
   <j.0:fundingPhase rdf:resource="http://data.younglives.org.uk/data/younglivesStudyStructure/FundingPhaseThree"/>
   <dc:description><![CDATA[ This article looks at what observable characteristics influence a child being persistently stunted, moving from being stunted or moving into being stunted in middle childhood, between 7 and 12, using longitudinal data for Andhra Pradesh. It finds the key factors that help a child move out of being stunted are mother's education and coming from the more prosperous region of Coastal Andhra. In contrast, the key factors that pushed a child into being stunted were the child being a girl and being a younger sibling. We also find that children who moved out of being stunted consume a diet higher in protein and micronutrients than others. The article suggests that even if a child starts middle childhood with significant shortfalls in height accrued from earlier on in life, nutritional interventions and adult female education may have a positive impact on linear growth and perhaps mitigate consequences of early age stunting.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Objective:  It is hypothesised that mothers' social networks can positively affect child nutrition through the sharing of health knowledge and other resources. The present study describes the composition of mothers' networks, examines their association with child nutrition, and assesses whether health knowledge is shared within networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Design and setting:  Cross-sectional data for mothers of young children from Andhra Pradesh (south India) were combined with existing data from the Young Lives study, in which the mothers were participating (n = 282).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Results:  The composition of social networks varied between urban and rural areas, with urban networks being larger, more female, more literate and with a greater proportion of members living outside the household and being non-family. There was a positive association between child's height-for-age Z-score and mother's network size and network literacy rate. The association with network literacy was stronger among the poorest households. Women commonly reported seeking or receiving health advice from network members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Conclusion:  Big and literate social networks are associated with better child nutrition, especially among the poor. The dissemination of health knowledge between network members is a plausible way in which social networks benefit child nutrition in India. Further research into the underlying mechanisms is necessary to inform the development of interventions that channel health information through word of mouth to the most excluded and vulnerable families.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Sense of belonging is the degree to which students feel integrated with their peers and teachers at school. This study describes sense of belonging among Peruvian students entering high school. Socioeconomic status had no direct effect on sense of belonging but had an indirect effect through achievement. Rural students had a higher sense of belonging than their urban peers. This is likely due to rural children seeing the larger, better equipped high schools as improvements over their relatively small and more isolated primary schools. Some general orientation activities were organized by teachers and principals aimed at all incoming first graders but nothing was designed specifically for students who might face difficulties in adjusting to high school.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Social capital is a relatively new concept which has attracted significant attention in recent years. No consensus has yet been reached on how to measure social capital, resulting in a large number of different tools available. While psychometric validation methods such as factor analysis have been used by a few studies to assess the internal validity of some tools, these techniques rely on data already collected by the tool and are therefore not capable of eliciting what the questions are actually measuring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The Young Lives (YL) study includes quantitative measures of caregiver's social capital in four countries (Vietnam, Peru, Ethiopia, and India) using a short version of the Adapted Social Capital Assessment Tool (SASCAT). A range of different psychometric methods including factor analysis were used to evaluate the construct validity of SASCAT in Peru and Vietnam. In addition, qualitative cognitive interviews with 20 respondents from Peru and 24 respondents from Vietnam were conducted to explore what each question is actually measuring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
We argue that psychometric validation techniques alone are not sufficient to adequately validate multi-faceted social capital tools for use in different cultural settings. Psychometric techniques show SASCAT to be a valid tool reflecting known constructs and displaying postulated links with other variables. However, results from the cognitive interviews present a more mixed picture with some questions being appropriately interpreted by respondents, and others displaying significant differences between what the researchers intended them to measure and what they actually do.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using evidence from a range of methods of assessing validity has enabled the modification of an existing instrument into a valid and low cost tool designed to measure social capital within larger surveys in Peru and Vietnam, with the potential for use in other developing countries following local piloting and cultural adaptation of the tool.

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ In this paper, we use a longitudinal data set that follows three thousand children in Vietnam to study the economic significance of childhood poverty–cognitive achievement nexus.Focusing on the consequences of stunting, we look at height-for-age z-score (HAZ), and trace the impact of HAZ on child cognitive achievement independent of the source of HAZ's variation - whether it comes from the variation in child characteristics at birth and the environmental factors, or in the household characteristics (stature, socioeconomic status, etc.). An increase by a standard deviation of HAZ at the age of one expectedly leads to an increase by one fourth of a standard deviation of the log score in a widely-used test of language ability at the age of five. For a quantitative cognitive achievement test, the corresponding figure is 0.20. Our evidence suggests that some of the disadvantages in socioeconomic status are being transmitted across generations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A separate 1-page Research Summary, which presents the main findings and policy implications of the Working Paper in easily understood language, is also attached.

   <dc:description> Extra classes are increasingly observed in both developed and developing countries. In Vietnam, a country where education reforms are at their height, extra classes are proliferating and have become a concern to society and the government. Although the government has banned extra classes that are independent of school administration, teachers often run home-based classes to supplement their income. This paper examines the extent and characteristics of extra classes among 8-year-old children, and examines the association between taking extra classes and learning outcomes (numeracy, reading and writing skills). </dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Young Lives is a longitudinal research project investigating the changing nature of childhood
poverty. The study is tracking the development of 12,000 children in Ethiopia, Peru, India
(Andhra Pradesh) and Vietnam through qualitative and quantitative research over a 15-year
period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To fit the main objectives of the project, Young Lives employed a sentinel site sampling
method, which is a multistage sampling approach and uses both purposive and probability
sampling methods. While households within the sites were selected by a method equivalent
to random sampling, the site selection process was not random and over sampling of poor
sites took place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this report is to assess the chosen sampling methodology for Andhra Pradesh
(India) and to analyse the comparability of Young Lives first round data with data from the
Demographic and Health Survey 1998/99 (DHS) (IIPS 2000). The DHS is a household survey
that provides data for a wide range of monitoring and impact evaluation indicators in the areas
of population, health, and nutrition. The DHS 1998/99 provides regionally representative data
for Andhra Pradesh. The sample consists of 4,032 women and 3,872 households.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By comparing data from Young Lives and the DHS, the study attempts to answer two
questions: (i) what are we looking at in the Young Lives data set? (ii) to what extent is the
Young Lives sample reflective of the population of 1-year-old and 8-year-old children in
Andhra Pradesh?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outline of the report is as follows. Section 2 presents the sampling approach that was
adopted by Young Lives. Section 3 presents variables used for the comparison and
discusses the results of the statistical comparison tests. Section 4 concludes. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ The Young Lives Project is a longitudinal study in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam. In each of the countries, the first phase of the project included the first survey of 2,000 index children aged around one year and a survey of 1,000 children aged around eight years, evenly spread across 20 sentinel sites per country. The Young Lives Project is unique in measuring child well-being in a holistic and consistent way across several developing countries, including economic, social, physical and demographic aspects. Data collection finished in 2003 and an important priority has been the early production of a preliminary report from each country, each report following a similar structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this preliminary report are to: present a brief literature review of child poverty in
Peru; review national policies that have an impact on child poverty; identify key national audiences for this study; and describe the study methods, present preliminary, descriptive results, and identify provisional conclusions and policy implications. ]]></dc:description>

   <dc:description><![CDATA[ Do children with access to private tutoring feel happier than those without? In answering this question, this paper offers a novel way to understand the potential merit of providing private tutoring for children. Using a unique data set on Vietnamese children from Round 2 of the Young Lives 2006 Survey, this paper explores the link between taking extra classes and a child's subjective well-being, measured by degree of satisfaction regarding their current and future life. Estimation results from Ordinary Least-Square regressions indicate such a link to be positive and significant, which is further confirmed by Ordered Probit regressions aiming to control for the discontinuous nature of the dependent variable. To control for potential endogeneity of households' choice to purchase extra classes, the method of Propensity Score Matching is applied. Results from different versions of nearest-neighbour matching and Kernel matching indicate that children with private tutoring tend to feel happier about their current life, although the long-run effect of taking extra classes on a child's subjective well-being is more sensitive to the matching methods used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A separate 1-page Research Summary, which presents the main findings and policy implications of the Working Paper in easily understood language, is also attached.

   <dc:description> This paper examines the mixed impact of the implementation of education policies aimed at ethnic minorities in Vietnam. It draws on the Young Lives survey in 2005 and a qualitative research on 23 Kinh (the majority), Hmong and H'Roi children from the Young Lives sample in Lao Cai and Phu Yen provinces in 2008. The paper finds that despite a conspicuous expansion in access to basic education for ethnic minority students the majority-minority gap in educational achievement persists. Case studies suggest that an uneven allocation of resources partly accounts for the varying record of performance across regions, i.e., between lowlanders and highlanders, and between those who are the direct beneficiaries of socio-development aid and those who are not. Children's experiences in education and development programs, presented in their own voices, mirror their place in the existing structure of inequality in the society. By situating the children's experience in the local political economy, the paper seeks to highlight the dynamics between education and other sources of marginalisation from which some children continue to suffer. </dc:description>
