   <rdfs:comment><![CDATA[This area of our work explores how the different dimensions of poverty overlap and interact to influence different children&#8217;s life-chances. 

Our work here focuses largely on the household level and aims to understand the factors that lead to improvements in the circumstances and livelihoods of some families and communities while others remain entrenched in poverty. 

We also look at livelihoods and the effects of structural inequalities and processes on households, how families cope with adverse events and uncertainty, and their impact on children. 

Our analysis includes the political, economic, social and environmental challenges and constraints experienced by Young Lives families. In this way we pay particular attention to policy measures and programmes that aim to support families and children.

The key questions are:
How are inequalities changing over time and what is the impact of major trends such as economic growth or migration on poverty, children and their families?&#13;
How does the poverty cycle function, and how can it be broken?&#13;
What are the emerging sources of uncertainty and change for children?&#13;
How do households manage, adapt and cope with risk, and how are children affected?&#13;

   <rdfs:comment><![CDATA[Poverty has diverse manifestations, including the lack of income and productive resources required to ensure a sustainable livelihood. This area of our work aims to explore the links between childhood poverty, the strategies people use to earn their living and the assets available to them, and the intergenerational transmission of poverty.

Livelihoods are not just a matter of household decision-making but a more complex array of interactions, where children are also actors who make certain strategies possible and are affected by them. This area of our work captures not only relevant household data but also seeks to understand who controls household assets and who benefits from their use.

Families living in urban or rural areas experience different pressures on their income and will employ different strategies to try to ensure a decent livelihood. In rural areas, these will consist of agricultural intensification, livelihood diversification (particularly informal work) and migration. In urban areas, families relying on informal work (non-wage income) may be more vulnerable than those with a regular, dependable source of income.

There are important distinctions to be made between accumulative, adaptive, coping, and survival strategies. Accumulative strategies increase consumption or assets in response to opportunity (the rich years) and adaptive strategies seek to spread risk (in lean years). In extreme circumstances, coping strategies may lead to survival strategies where consumption may be drastically reduced and household assets eroded.]]></rdfs:comment>

   <rdfs:comment><![CDATA[Social protection, commonly understood as government schemes to mitigate risk and reduce vulnerability and/or chronic poverty, has moved up the policy and research agenda in recent years. There is an active debate about whether the focus should be more on asset-building or &#8216;safety-net&#8217; activities, whether and how conditions are attached to cash transfers, and about the underlying assumptions about decision-making within households and their ability to take advantage of such schemes. Further, there have been calls to make social protection more predictable, increase coverage and improve delivery.

Most research and policy debate focuses on the effects of social protection on households, with children assumed to be passive beneficiaries. In Young Lives we look at intra-household dynamics, the impact of programmes on children, and how evidence can be used to develop policies that are more child-sensitive. 

We are currently running a series of sub-studies, looking in particular at the impact of the Protective Safety Net Programme (PSNP) in Ethiopia, the National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme (NREGS) in India, the cash transfer scheme Juntos in Peru, and the health insurance scheme in Vietnam. 

Our research finds that social protection schemes have both intended and unintended consequences for children, mostly positive but highlighting areas of concern that should be prioritised in programme design. For example, many social protection programme have moved in the direction of conditional cash transfers (CCTs) and the conditions attached to receipt of benefits are often directly aimed at child &#8216;welfare&#8217;, such as school attendance or visits to the health clinic. However, insights from qualitative analysis and child perspectives are useful to assist with better programme design.

These findings must also be considered along with other evidence that documents how children are contributing to the household economy and managing risks themselves and with their families, and limited evidence on the extent to which increased work impacts on children&#8217;s schooling.]]></rdfs:comment>

   <rdfs:comment><![CDATA[Access to services (including health) is a topical issue in international policy circles. The World Development Report in 2004 looked at how services often fail poor people in terms of access, quantity and quality. It is recognised that barriers to access are an important obstacle to meeting the Millennium Development Goals, especially Goal 4 to reduce the under-5 mortality rate by two-thirds. 

The services available to a community, such as electricity, clean water and sanitation, health services, education and transport, are not only an indicator of the resources available within that community &#8211; and thus a factor in all multi-dimensional measurement of poverty &#8211; but they also have a direct impact on poverty levels and child well-being. Clean water improves child nutrition and health outcomes. Access to transport and roads opens up more and better income opportunities. 

Analysis of Round 1 Young Lives data demonstrated marked disparities in the use of health services according to socio-economic indicators, such as wealth and rural/urban location. There were also differences between the Older Cohort families, who appeared to be &#8216;better-off&#8217; than Younger Cohort families, perhaps due to the maturity of the family unit.

Evidence in Round 2 showed a relatively fast spread of improved sanitation and water. This improved coverage is impressive, but as with education, is only part of the story &#8211; usage is the key indicator. Our data show an average improvement in all of our study countries, but unpicking this further demonstrates ongoing differences, particularly between rural and urban areas and between the better-off and poorer families.

One of the clearest positive achievements associated with the MDGs has been around access to school. The most often quoted target is, of course, universal primary enrolment, although alongside this there are related targets around completing a course of primary-level education and subsequent literacy. We see clear evidence of gains in the first of these targets, but less clear evidence on the third. Our work around access to education is presented in the Theme area on Learning, time-use and life transitions.]]></rdfs:comment>

   <rdfs:label>Children's experiences of poverty</rdfs:label>
   <rdfs:comment><![CDATA[This theme focuses on children&#8217;s well-being and how boys and girls experience poverty and related adversities. It will explore the impact these experiences have on their lives, the role of their family and peer relationships in moderating impact, and the protective effect of public policies and informal actions undertaken by children, their peers, their families and communities.

The development and well-being of children and young people is often doubly compromised by the interaction of multiple risks. This is large to due to the close association between poverty and environmental, structural and individual risks. This theme is concerned to identify how diverse risks, including structural inequalities and related social exclusion, play out in the lives of children as they grow up. It will look at &#8216;subjective&#8217; indicators (children&#8217;s own perspectives on poverty, their aspirations, choices and priorities) as well as &#8216;objective&#8217; indicators such as their health, nutrition, education and social outcomes, and how these intersect with their learning and the process of growing up.

At the same time, children living in poverty are often involved in the reduction of risks for themselves and their families from an early age; hence the importance of analysing the roles and responsibilities of boys and girls in this context, their own agency and ways of managing risk, and their expectations and aspirations for the future. This also enables us to further investigate the multiple routes of poverty transmission from the point of view of children&#8217;s experience.

Our research questions in this area are:
What are the different factors that shape children&#8217;s well-being in different developmental domains?&#13;
What are the major sources of risk, vulnerability, resilience and protection in children and young people&#8217;s lives?&#13;
How do policies and the actions of children and young people, their peers, families and communities affect their well-being and protection?&#13;

   <rdfs:comment><![CDATA[Adversity is not an exceptional circumstance but, to a degree, forms part of everyday life for all children. At the same time poverty and related deprivations remains one of the most significant sources of risk for children throughout the world. Poverty is also associated with other adversities, including those at the household level such as losing a parent, and those affecting wider populations, like natural disasters or human conflict. Often the development and well-being of poor children is doubly compromised by the interaction of multiple hardships.

Young Lives looks at a variety of adverse events that affect families at both community and household levels, including financial shocks, unemployment, environmental, crop failure, death, illness, divorce and crime.

However, risk cannot always be defined objectively and the subjective perceptions and actions of affected populations can be crucial to impact and outcome, especially in the case of &#8216;social&#8217; risks like workplace exploitation and migration. Children&#8217;s perceptions are seldom predictable and their actions (and those of their families and communities) can make a major difference to outcomes, even in situations of severe hardship.

So we look at how national, community and household-level shocks (for example, drought or the death of a caregiver) affect children&#8217;s health, well-being and development; and how exposure to risk varies with poverty and what makes particular children more vulnerable or resilient. 

We also explore the effects of policy interventions on reducing children&#8217;s vulnerability (for example, through social protection or child protection programmes) and how these interact with the strategies of children and their families to manage risk.

Currently the Oak Foundation is supporting a sub-study to specifically look at the challenges and opportunities for linking research-to-practice in the areas of orphans and vulnerability among children in Ethiopia. We are carrying out a similar project in India focusing on child labour.

   <rdfs:comment><![CDATA[Poverty can be both a cause and a result of ill-health, which often results in a vicious circle that is very hard to break. Poor living conditions, insufficient diets and inadequate healthcare usage can lead to ill-health and under-nutrition in children and their families. In turn, ill-health of a family member often results in substantial healthcare costs and loss of income, dragging impoverished families even deeper into poverty.

Due to its multidimensional approach Young Lives is well positioned to explore the role of health for children/families moving in and out of poverty; health and children's abilities to thrive; health and children's resilience and access; usage and quality of health services; and child outcomes.

Another strength of Young Lives is the longitudinal nature of the study which enables us to investigate the mid- and long-term effects of ill-health and poor nutrition while controlling for a huge number of environmental and social factors. Our multidisciplinary approach also allows analysis from several different points of views and methodologies.

In all survey rounds we look at each child&#8217;s diet, height and weight; injury, chronic and disabling conditions; usage of healthcare; self-rated health status; and the health status of household members. In Round 3 we also started to collect data on adolescent health risk behaviours (sexual health, tobacco and alcohol use, emotional well-being, experience of violence) in the older cohort (15-year-olds).

Increasingly important areas of Young Lives research include potential links between health and psychosocial competencies and emerging obesity in Young Lives children and their parents. 

The paradoxical coexistence of child under-nutrition and maternal overweight within the same household, often described as &#8216;dual burden of malnutrition&#8217;, has been observed in all Young Lives countries, but is a particular public health concern in Peru.

   <rdfs:comment><![CDATA[Poverty, particularly child poverty, has many dimensions. If we look only at material measures, we miss key dimensions that matter for children&#8217;s experience of poverty as well as the opportunities they will have later in life. Young Lives collects information from children on their values, aspirations, and psychosocial well-being, as well as the traditional indicators of deprivation, so as to construct a holistic understanding of childhood poverty. As part of our qualitative research, our child questionnaires pose a number of questions to allow us to measure perceptions, feelings and attitudes reflecting characteristics such as agency and self-efficacy, self-esteem, aspirations and respect. 

Longitudinal research into the links between poverty and psychosocial indicators is a unique feature of Young Lives. By following the same group of children, we can trace how poverties and inequalities affect their well-being, what inequalities exist in children&#8217;s health, nutrition and well-being and how they affect their physical, social and cognitive development over time, and so also explore how their aspirations, priorities and strategies change over time and affect their life trajectories.

We also explore what economic, physical, health and psychosocial factors children and their caregivers think are important to well-being. To show subjective well-being, children in the Young Lives survey are asked to think about how they are faring in life and to place themselves on a nine-rung &#8216;ladder of life&#8217; (where the top rung represents the best life possible and the lowest rung the worst). They are then asked to imagine where they see themselves in four years&#8217; time; we use this as an indicator of children&#8217;s sense of optimism. 

We have found that both stunting and low spending power of families have further profound impacts on children&#8217;s lives and experiences in terms of their self-esteem, sense of shame, respect and of inclusion. 

Self-esteem and other related perceptions are connected to many different influences in a child&#8217;s life, including the support given by family members, the quality of friendships, cultural values and other factors.

Well-being is, of course, affected by poverty and shocks, but some findings are surprising. For example, while the death of a parent at any age is a significant and distressing event, Young Lives research in Ethiopia finds that the age the child is when a parent dies is important. If a parent dies early on in a child&#8217;s life (between ages 0 and 6) then the death per se does not seem to affect children&#8217;s sense of optimism or self-esteem at age 12, in part due to the fact that younger children are more likely to be cared for by close relatives. But, if the father dies in middle childhood (between ages 7 and 12) it seems to reduce the child&#8217;s sense of optimism.

   <rdfs:comment><![CDATA[Here we focus on how notions of what constitutes a &#8216;good childhood&#8217; vary between groups of children (including by wealth, gender or ethnicity) and explore the factors including poverty that shape these views. 

Worldwide, there are many studies of adults&#8217; understandings of well-being or ill-being. Children&#8217;s views and experiences are rarely covered. Young Lives uses survey and qualitative data to address how understandings of a good life and what is needed to achieve this differ between different types of community and children from different backgrounds within those communities.

For example, in Ethiopia we found that children&#8217;s material ambitions were higher in the cities, where they wanted &#8216;a table full of a variety of food like a buffet&#8217; rather than simply &#8216;sufficient food&#8217;. Urban children wanted cars and DVDs, whereas rural children wanted irrigated land or cattle.

Young people growing up in poor communities are usually aware of inequalities and injustices, including their own disadvantaged situations. They see material inequalities as indicative of wider power and position differences, of which they are very much a part. But as children get older, the social impacts of poverty become more debilitating. Material deprivation impacts on young people&#8217;s social relations and their capacity to participate in the wider world. 

Children&#8217;s concerns, explanations, and experiences of the effects of poverty may differ from adults. They often have distinct roles and responsibilities within their families for managing hardship and risk related to household poverty (such as caring for siblings, carrying out essential household chores, working for pay, and going to school). 

There may also be important differences in patterns of children&#8217;s awareness and understanding or inequality, reflecting their varied positioning in the social hierarchy and the range of social hierarchy and the range of social expectations they manage (which may, for example, be related to age, gender, class and ethnicity/caste).

Focusing on children&#8217;s descriptions, explanations, and experiences of poverty and inequality highlights implications for research, policy and practice, and rights. For example, our research in India has highlighted the importance of social relationships, namely their families and friendships, for shaping children&#8217;s experiences of poverty; this should therefore be reflected in children-centred policies and programmes.

   <rdfs:comment><![CDATA[The quality of the relationships and support children enjoy are closely linked to children&#8217;s levels of <a href="http://www.younglives.org.uk/our-themes/childrens-experiences-of-poverty/risk-and-resilience" class="internal-link">risk and resilience</a>. The nature of their relationships at home, school or in the community affect their experiences of growing up and their diverse trajectories over time.

The children in the Young Lives sample all put great emphasis on strong relationships, especially in the family. Many are carers for younger siblings or sick family members. Peer relationships become increasingly important as children get older, especially as they change schools or move communities. 

We also ask children about their social capital (their connectedness to people around them, such as peers, friends, family members and neighbours). Each child is asked about frequency of play and support.&#160; Support is measured by asking about the availability of someone to help them.

We explore to what extent children have agency in making decisions in matters affecting their lives and what choices they have. The opportunities and experiences of caregivers affect their children&#8217;s outcomes too.

We also look at the roles and responsibilities children have within their households and how these contribute to their sense of <a href="http://www.younglives.org.uk/our-themes/childrens-experiences-of-poverty/psychosocial-well-being" class="internal-link">well-being and development</a>. For example, in Ethiopia work is a central feature of the lives of girls and boys and this work is essential for the household economy. Intra-household relations are better described as &#8216;interdependent&#8217; rather than being about children&#8217;s dependence on and subordination to parents and caregivers within the household. In contexts of high household risk, interdependence may be a highly protective factor that reduces household vulnerability. Children acquire skills and capacities through the work they perform that helps themselves and others within the household.

Beyond family, extended family, friends, school and religious institutions, there are also formal and informal sources of community support available from the government and NGOs (such as formal and informal social protection).

   <rdfs:comment><![CDATA[As a study of childhood poverty over time, Young Lives is able to look at the changing ways in which boys and girls spend their time as they grow up as well as their experiences of school, work and caring for others in their family, and how these influence children&#8217;s pathways from early childhood into adulthood. This theme addresses three broad areas of analysis: children&#8217;s roles, responsibilities and how they spend their time; their learning in formal and informal contexts, and their transitions to adulthood.
What role does school play in breaking the cycle of poverty?&#13;
What is the significance of work in the lives of children and young people?&#13;
How does poverty affect how children and young people use their time, and how does their time-use affect poverty?&#13;
What are the most important skill acquisition processes for children and young people as they prepare for their adult lives?&#13;
What factors shape the major transitions boys and girls experience from infancy to adulthood, and what are the outcomes?&#13;

   <rdfs:comment><![CDATA[High-quality early childhood care and education (ECCE) is now recognised as a core strategy for poverty reduction. There is evidence of high returns from ECCE investments, which can contribute to global policy priorities such as tackling child malnutrition, increasing children&#8217;s successful participation in school, and strengthening economic development. In short, by supporting children and families early in life, well-delivered ECCE can help to interrupt the cycle of poverty. But the reality is that this potential only becomes meaningful if ECCE programmes are actually able to effectively reach the poorest and most marginalised children.]]></rdfs:comment>

   <rdfs:comment>One of the clearest achievements associated with the Millennium Development Goals has been rapid increases in school enrolment at primary level. Since children from poorer backgrounds have historically had much lower chances of going to school, moving towards universal primary enrolment has the potential to be of particular benefit to them. Data from the Young Lives survey mirrors this increasing primary school enrolment, but also shows that this is only part of a more complicated picture. Enrolment does not mean that a child will always turn up for school, that they will receive a good education, or that formal school will furnish them with skills and knowledge useful in their day-to-day lives.</rdfs:comment>

Considering how effectively children learn is important for understanding how they will gain the skills they need for adult life, particularly how they will move into the labour market. Our research highlights how important it is to consider not just formal, school-based learning but its value alongside the other skills and competencies that are valued by children and the communities in which they live which are acquired more informally.]]></rdfs:comment>

   <rdfs:comment><![CDATA[In the course of growing up, children experience many different changes, or transitions, in their life. They move into and out of education, may migrate, experience sickness or death in their family, start work, and eventually might marry and have children of their own. Poverty plays a vital part in shaping these life events.

As a longitudinal study, Young Lives looks at transitions as they happened (past), as they are happening (present) and as they might happen in the future (expectations). We document the stories children tell about their lives, the changing contexts in which they live, and represent their experiences both at a particular point in time and over time. By revisiting the same children over time, we explore how transitions are interrelated; looking, for example, at how one process of change (such as early marriage) creates or cuts off opportunities for transition in other areas (such as educational attainment), and how this affects what children consider imaginable, possible and desirable for their lives.

Transitions are not fixed pathways or &#8216;steps&#8217; in the life-course through which individual children pass, but processes of change in relation to both settings and identities: a change in one area may have a ripple effect onto others. Nor do transitions necessarily mean discontinuity. Children look forward to certain transitions and view them as windows of opportunity, for example, to make new friends or to enhance their status within their peer group. 

Children and their caregivers, service providers and community leaders may have different views on the importance specific events have on children&#8217;s well-being and future lives, and what is needed to make these changes. What is normal and appropriate, in general, and what is normal and appropriate for an individual child can vary. Age, gender, class and caste all shape expectations and experiences. 

We are interested in the changes children have experienced, and those they anticipate in their near and not-so-near future. Young Lives children are not just &#8216;poor&#8217;; they are social actors with aspirations beyond simply getting out of poverty. Our findings will be able to explain their diverging pathways.]]></rdfs:comment>

There are many different types of work &#8211; from helping with chores within the home, unpaid work on family farms (such as herding or harvest), to waged labour at home or in another business. Some of this work may be exploitative, involving long hours or harmful practices. Equally, work is a common feature of the way in which children interact in their communities, how they learn skills, and (for good or bad) how children contribute to family livelihoods and gain a sense of confidence and pride in their own abilities.]]></rdfs:comment>

   <rdfs:comment><![CDATA[Our work to date has shown significant inequalities persist within the Young Lives countries. Although the pro-poor design of the study precludes straight comparison between the richest and poorest sectors of society, it does allow us to look at the differences between Young Lives children and to analyse the mechanisms and processes that mean that inequality is perpetuated. We are particularly interested in differences associated with gender, ethnicity and caste, urban or regional residence, region, and family wealth. 

These inequalities are of clear importance because of what they imply for children&#8217;s life-chances and because of what we can learn about the effectiveness of policy in delivering better outcomes for all children. Therefore we are increasingly disaggregating our data and synthesising findings and policy material from across the study to draw out messages situated in an analysis of political economy contexts and relevant policy debates.]]></rdfs:comment>
